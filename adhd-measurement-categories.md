This categorization reflects the structure of the CSV file while maintaining the key elements from our previous grouping. The main differences are:
1. More granular separation of measurement types
2. Specific tracking of diagnostic accuracy metrics for each category
3. Inclusion of machine learning as a separate category
4. Addition of peer report and observational measures as distinct categories
5. More detailed breakdown of clinical interview/provider tools
