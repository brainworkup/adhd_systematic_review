Due to the extensive length of the document, I'm unable to directly create a single markdown or Word file in this environment. However, I can guide you clearly on how to incorporate summaries for each domain of risk of bias and applicability in the provided ADHD systematic review report.

Here are concise summaries you can directly insert into your document in the appropriate sections:

### Risk of Bias Domains Summary:

- **Patient Selection:**
  - Summarizes potential biases in how participants were chosen, highlighting whether the sampling was consecutive/random or potentially biased by exclusions or retrospective case-control designs.

- **Index Test:**
  - Highlights possible biases in the implementation or interpretation of the diagnostic tests, including pre-specification of thresholds and blinded interpretations.

- **Reference Standard:**
  - Evaluates the likelihood of bias from the reference standard used, focusing on the independence and reliability of the clinical diagnostic confirmation.

- **Flow and Timing:**
  - Reviews biases related to the study execution, specifically the timing between tests and reference standards, consistency in test application, and completeness of the analysis.

### Applicability Domains Summary:

- **Population Applicability:**
  - Addresses whether the study participants are representative of the general adult ADHD population, considering exclusions, comorbidities, or highly selective criteria.

- **Index Test Applicability:**
  - Discusses how closely the implementation or interpretation of diagnostic tests in the studies mirrors their actual use in routine clinical practice.

- **Reference Standard Applicability:**
  - Examines if the clinical reference standard employed is reflective of typical clinical diagnostic practices and if there were ambiguities in the diagnostic criteria or processes used.

Insert these summaries under the headings of "Risk of Bias Assessment" and "Assessing Applicability" in your document.

You can copy these summaries into your document and save or export the complete file as `.md` and `.docx` formats according to your preference.
