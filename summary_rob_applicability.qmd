## Risk of Bias Assessment (Figure 1)

### Patient Selection and Confounding
**Summary**: Nearly 50% of studies demonstrated high risk of bias in patient selection, with only about 20% showing low risk. This suggests prevalent issues with how participants were recruited and selected across the evidence base.

### Tool/Index Test
**Summary**: Approximately 60% of studies exhibited high risk of bias in the index test domain, with only about 10% showing low risk, indicating widespread concerns about how diagnostic tools were applied and interpreted.

### Reference Standard
**Summary**: The reference standard domain showed the most favorable profile, with about 60% of studies at low risk of bias and about 20% at high risk, suggesting relatively good quality in how the diagnostic "gold standard" was implemented.

### Flow and Timing
**Summary**: Nearly 60% of studies showed high risk of bias in flow and timing, with only about 15% at low risk, indicating significant concerns about the sequence and intervals of test administration and analysis.

## Applicability Assessment (Figure 2)

### Population
**Summary**: Only about 10% of studies had no applicability concerns regarding population, with the vast majority having narrow eligibility criteria or including more complex patients than typical of community settings.

### Test
**Summary**: Approximately 50% of studies had no applicability concerns regarding the test, though many others used tests not common in current practice or employed highly selected teams not representative of typical clinical settings.

### Reference Standard
**Summary**: About 50% of studies had no applicability concerns for the reference standard, with remaining studies showing unclear DSM-5 diagnostic criteria or other reference standard issues limiting generalizability.

### Outcomes
**Summary**: About 45% of studies had no applicability concerns regarding outcomes, with many others using surrogate outcomes that may not directly translate to clinical practice.

### Setting
**Summary**: Only about 20% of studies had no applicability concerns regarding setting, with the vast majority conducted in care levels different from community settings, limiting their generalizability to routine practice.
