## Summary of Risk of Bias Domains:

  

- **Patient selection and confounding:** Most studies showed a high risk of bias, indicating substantial concerns about the potential influence of participant selection methods or unaddressed confounding factors.

  

- **Tool/Index test:** The majority of studies were classified as high risk, suggesting significant issues related to how tests were administered or interpreted.

  

- **Reference standard:** This domain predominantly exhibited a low risk of bias, suggesting confidence in the quality and independence of the reference standards used.

  

- **Flow and Timing:** Many studies showed a high risk of bias, implying concerns about appropriate intervals between index and reference tests, consistency of test application, or completeness of participant inclusion in analyses.

  

## Summary of Applicability Domains:

  

- **Population:** Most studies had concerns related to narrow eligibility criteria and exclusions of participants with comorbidities, limiting generalizability.

  

- **Test:** A notable proportion of studies used tests not commonly applied in current clinical practice, reducing the direct applicability of these results.

  

- **Reference standard:** Generally applicable with few concerns, although some studies did not clearly adhere to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

  

- **Outcomes:** Frequently involved surrogate outcomes rather than direct clinical measures, somewhat restricting real-world applicability.

  

- **Setting:** A significant portion of studies involved levels of care different from typical community settings, potentially limiting external validity.
