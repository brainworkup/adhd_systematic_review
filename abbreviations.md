## Neuroimaging and ADHD Study Results: Abbreviations and Definitions 

**ADHD**: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

**fMRI**: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging - a type of neuroimaging that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. 

**DTI**: Diffusion Tensor Imaging - a type of MRI that measures the diffusion of water molecules in the brain, providing information about the white matter tracts and their integrity. 

**ROI**: Region of Interest - a predefined area of the brain selected for analysis, typically based on prior knowledge or hypotheses about the region's involvement in a particular function or disorder. 

**MNI**: Montreal Neurological Institute - a standardized template of the brain, used as a common space for reporting coordinates of brain activation or structural differences in neuroimaging studies. 

**BOLD**: Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent - the type of contrast used in fMRI to measure changes in blood flow and oxygenation, which correlate with neural activity. 

**SPM**: Statistical Parametric Mapping - a software used for analyzing neuroimaging data, allowing for the statistical analysis of functional or structural differences across groups or conditions. 

**MDD**: Major Depressive Disorder - a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and other cognitive and physical symptoms. Often comorbid with ADHD. 

**ANOVA**: Analysis of Variance - a statistical test used to compare means between three or more groups, used in neuroimaging to compare brain activation or structural differences between multiple groups or conditions. 

**FWE**: Family-Wise Error - a correction method used in multiple comparisons to control for the probability of false positives across the whole brain or within a specific ROI. 

**t-stat**: T-statistic - a value used in statistical tests to indicate the magnitude of the difference between two groups, calculated by dividing the difference between group means by the standard error. 

**p-value**: The probability value that the observed results occurred by random chance. 

**SDQ**: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - a behavioral screening tool used to assess emotional and behavioral difficulties in children and adolescents. 

**DSM-V**: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition - a widely used manual for the diagnosis of mental disorders, including ADHD. 

**ICD-11**: International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision - a global standard for diagnosing health conditions, including mental disorders. 

**IQ**: Intelligence Quotient - a score derived from standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. 

**MPRAGE**: Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo - an MRI sequence used to acquire high-resolution structural images of the brain. 

**TR**: Repetition Time - the time it takes to acquire a single volume of data in an MRI scan. 

**TE**: Echo Time - the time between the application of an MRI pulse and the peak of the resulting signal. 

**FA**: Fractional Anisotropy - a measure of the directionality of water diffusion in DTI, used to assess the integrity of white matter tracts. 

**MD**: Mean Diffusivity - a measure of the average mobility of water molecules in DTI, reflecting overall water diffusion within the brain. 

**RL**: Right-to-Left - used to indicate the direction of a particular contrast or comparison in a neuroimaging study. 

**LR**: Left-to-Right - used to indicate the direction of a particular contrast or comparison in a neuroimaging study. 

**BA**: Brodmann Area - a system for dividing the cerebral cortex into distinct areas based on cytoarchitectural differences, used as a reference in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging. 

**RDoC**: Research Domain Criteria - a framework proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health for classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures.
