    "The research report identified several limitations in the accuracy of the QbTestÂ® for diagnosing adult ADHD:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Low Discriminative Power**: The QbTest has a low ability to distinguish between ADHD and other psychiatric disorders, with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of only 0.65.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sensitivity and Specificity Issues**: The sensitivity is about 68% at a specificity of 48%, indicating a high rate of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Limited Utility in Complex Cases**: The test may not perform well in cases with multiple comorbidities or unclear ADHD presentations, as it was primarily validated in straightforward cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Variability in Results**: Results can vary significantly based on the population tested, making it less effective in heterogeneous samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Dependence on Clinical Context**: The QbTest is meant to complement clinical interviews and other diagnostic tools, rather than serve as a standalone measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Age and Gender Factors**: The test may not adequately account for variations in ADHD symptoms based on age and gender, affecting diagnostic accuracy across different demographic groups."
