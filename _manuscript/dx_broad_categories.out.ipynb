    "<!-- I'd like to note that some studies used multiple measurement types or combined approaches (for example, EEG with clinical measures, or neuropsychological testing with rating scales). In these cases, I categorized them based on their primary measurement approach. Additionally, there appears to be a growing trend toward using machine learning techniques to analyze data across multiple measurement types. -->"
