# METHODOLOGICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT IN ADULT ADHD DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

## SYSTEMATIC FRAMEWORK FOR BIAS EVALUATION

## I. ESTABLISHED CRITERIA - QUADAS-2 FRAMEWORK
The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool provides the foundational framework for evaluating risk of bias, specifically adapted for adult ADHD diagnostic studies:

## DOMAIN 1: PATIENT SELECTION
Low Risk Criteria:
- Consecutive or random sampling explicitly documented
- Case-control design avoided or appropriately justified
- Inappropriate exclusions avoided
- Clear documentation of recruitment strategy

Unclear Risk Indicators:
- Insufficient description of sampling methodology
- Ambiguous selection criteria
- Limited documentation of recruitment process
- Unclear timeline of participant enrollment

High Risk Markers:
- Non-consecutive or non-random sampling
- Inappropriate case-control design
- Inappropriate exclusions affecting representativeness
- Substantial selection bias evident

DOMAIN 2: INDEX TEST
Low Risk Criteria:
- Test conducted according to standardized protocol
- Threshold pre-specified
- Test interpreters blinded to reference standard
- Clear documentation of test administration

DOMAIN 3: REFERENCE STANDARD
Low Risk Criteria:
- DSM-5/ICD-10 criteria properly implemented
- Reference standard results interpreted blind to index test
- Standardized diagnostic protocol followed
- Multi-informant data collection

DOMAIN 4: FLOW AND TIMING
Low Risk Criteria:
- Appropriate interval between index test and reference standard
- All participants receive same reference standard
- All participants included in analysis
- Clear documentation of assessment timeline

## II. INTER-RATER RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT
