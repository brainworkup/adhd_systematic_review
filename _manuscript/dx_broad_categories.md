## Clinical Rating Scales and Diagnostic Interviews (41 studies)
These include standardized questionnaires, structured interviews, and behavioral rating scales used by clinicians, such as:
- Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)
- Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview
- Wender Utah Rating Scale
- WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale
- MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview

## Neuropsychological and Cognitive Tests (32 studies)
Including measures of attention, executive function, and processing speed:
- Continuous Performance Tests (CPT)
- Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA)
- Woodcock-Johnson Tests
- Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test
- Stroop Color and Word Test

## Neuroimaging Studies (15 studies)
Including various brain imaging techniques:
- Functional MRI (fMRI)
- Structural MRI
- SPECT imaging
- Regional homogeneity analysis
- Machine learning applications to neuroimaging data

## EEG/Electrophysiological Measures (14 studies)
Including various forms of brain electrical activity measurement:
- Standard EEG analysis
- Event-Related Potentials (ERP)
- Quantitative EEG
- Network-oriented EEG analysis
- Machine learning applications to EEG data

## Biomarkers (8 studies)
Including biological and biochemical measures:
- Blood-based markers
- Oxidative status measures
- Erythropoietin levels
- microRNA profiles
- Membrane potential measurements

## Performance Validity/Effort Testing (6 studies)
Specialized measures to detect feigned symptoms:
- Personality Assessment Inventory
- Embedded validity indicators
- Symptom validity tests
- ADHD-specific malingering scales

<!-- I'd like to note that some studies used multiple measurement types or combined approaches (for example, EEG with clinical measures, or neuropsychological testing with rating scales). In these cases, I categorized them based on their primary measurement approach. Additionally, there appears to be a growing trend toward using machine learning techniques to analyze data across multiple measurement types. -->
