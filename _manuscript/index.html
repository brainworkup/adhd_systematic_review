<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Association between medication use for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and risk of motor vehicle crashes;,citation_abstract=Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a major public health problem. Research has demonstrated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to experience MVCs, but the effect of ADHD medication treatment on the risk of MVCs remains unclear.To explore associations between ADHD medication use and risk of MVCs in a large cohort of patients with ADHD.For this study, a US national cohort of patients with ADHD (n = 2 319 450) was identified from commercial health insurance claims between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, and followed up for emergency department visits for MVCs. The study used within-individual analyses to compare the risk of MVCs during months in which patients received ADHD medication with the risk of MVCs during months in which they did not receive ADHD medication.Dispensed prescription of ADHD medications.Emergency department visits for MVCs.Among 2 319 450 patients identified with ADHD, the mean (SD) age was 32.5 (12.8) years, and 51.7 % were female. In the within-individual analyses, male patients with ADHD had a 38 % (odds ratio, 0.62; 95 % CI, 0.56-0.67) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving ADHD medication compared with months when not receiving medication, and female patients had a 42 % (odds ratio, 0.58; 95 % CI, 0.53-0.62) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving ADHD medication. Similar reductions were found across all age groups, across multiple sensitivity analyses, and when considering the long-term association between ADHD medication use and MVCs. Estimates of the population-attributable fraction suggested that up to 22.1 % of the MVCs in patients with ADHD could have been avoided if they had received medication during the entire follow-up.Among patients with ADHD, rates of MVCs were lower during periods when they received ADHD medication. Considering the high prevalence of ADHD and its association with MVCs, these findings warrant attention to this prevalent and preventable cause of mortality and morbidity.;,citation_author=Zheng Chang;,citation_author=Patrick D.

(2003a). Neuropsychological Assessment Battery. Lutz, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.]) measures several aspects of visual attention thought to be important for driving ability. The current study examined the relationship between scores on the Driving Scenes test and on-road driving performance on a standardized driving test. Healthy participants performed significantly better on the Driving Scenes test than did very mildly demented participants. A correlation of 0.55 was found between the brief, office-based Driving Scenes test and the 108-point on-road driving score. Furthermore, the Driving Scenes test scores differed significantly across the driving instructor’s three global ratings (safe, marginal, and unsafe), and results of a discriminant function analysis indicated that the Driving Scenes test correctly classified 66 % of participants into these groups. Thus, the new NAB Driving Scenes test appears to have good ecological validity for real-world driving ability in normal and very mildly demented older adults.;,citation_author=Laura B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working memory and intelligence: The same or different constructs?;,citation_abstract=Several investigators have claimed over the past decade that working memory (WM) and general intelligence (g) are identical, or nearly identical, constructs, from an individual-differences perspective. Although memory measures are commonly included in intelligence tests, and memory abilities are included in theories of intelligence, the identity between WM and intelligence has not been evaluated comprehensively. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 86 samples that relate WM to intelligence. The average correlation between true-score estimates of WM and g is substantially less than unity (p=.479). The authors also focus on the distinction between short-term memory and WM with respect to intelligence with a supplemental meta-analysis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Clear evidence for item limits in visual working memory;,citation_abstract=There is a consensus that visual working memory (WM) resources are sharply limited, but debate persists regarding the simple question of whether there is a limit to the total number of items that can be stored concurrently. Zhang and Luck (2008) advanced this debate with an analytic procedure that provided strong evidence for random guessing responses, but their findings can also be described by models that deny guessing while asserting a high prevalence of low precision memories. Here, we used a whole report memory procedure in which subjects reported all items in each trial and indicated whether they were guessing with each response. Critically, this procedure allowed us to measure memory performance for all items in each trial. When subjects were asked to remember 6 items, the response error distributions for about 3 out of the 6 items were best fit by a parameter-free guessing model (i.e. a uniform distribution). In addition, subjects’ self-reports of guessing precisely tracked the guessing rate estimated with a mixture model. Control experiments determined that guessing behavior was not due to output interference, and that there was still a high prevalence of guessing when subjects were instructed not to guess. Our novel approach yielded evidence that guesses, not low-precision representations, best explain limitations in working memory. These guesses also corroborate a capacity-limited working memory system – we found evidence that subjects are able to report non-zero information for only 3–4 items. Thus, WM capacity is constrained by an item limit that precludes the storage of more than 3–4 individuated feature values.;,citation_author=Kirsten C. S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Associations of interpersonal trust with juvenile offending/conduct disorder, callous-unemotional traits, and criminal recidivism;,citation_abstract=Abstract Interpersonal trust has been described as a core dimension of cooperative, mutually beneficial interpersonal relationships but it is unclear if it is related to antisocial behaviours in youth. The present study aimed at analysing a subsample of male juveniles who committed serious violent offenses and met criteria of conduct disorder (JO/CD), and a subsample of healthy controls (HC) using a series of trust games (TGs). Twenty-four male JO/CD and 24 age matched male HC performed a series of eight one-shot TGs against different unknown human respectively computer opponents. Mixed model analyses found a non-significant trend that JO/CD invested less points than HC during TGs. In the subsample of JO/CD, the overall investment in TGs was found to be negatively associated with self-reported uncaring behaviours and officially reported general re-offenses. Our findings suggest some indication of an impaired ability of JO/CD to initiate mutually trusting relationships to others that should be addressed in further research. Trust is a promising factor to predict general criminal recidivism and can be a target for treatment of juveniles who committed violent offenses, for example through the building of stable relationships to care givers. This study encourages future studies to investigate the effects of trust-increasing psychosocial interventions.;,citation_author=Marcel Aebi;,citation_author=Melanie Haynes;,citation_author=Cornelia Bessler;,citation_author=Gregor Hasler;,citation_publication_date=2022-12;,citation_cover_date=2022-12;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11777-6;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41598-022-11777-6;,citation_issn=2045-2322;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sci Rep;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Oppositional defiant disorder dimensions and subtypes among detained male adolescent offenders;,citation_abstract=Background In adolescent offenders, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and its dimensions/subtypes have been frequently ignored due to the stronger focus on criminal behaviours. The revised criteria of the DSM-5 now allow diagnosing ODD in older youths independent of conduct disorder (CD). This study aimed at analysing ODD dimensions/subtypes and their relation to suicidality, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and criminal behaviours after release from detention in a sample of detained male adolescents. Methods Suicidality and psychiatric disorders (including ODD symptoms) were assessed in a consecutive sample of 158 male adolescents (Mage = 16.89 years) from the Zurich Juvenile Detention Centre. Based on previous research findings, an irritable ODD dimension and a defiant/vindictive ODD dimension based on ODD symptoms were defined. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify distinct subtypes of adolescent offenders according to their ODD symptom profiles. Logistic regression and Cox regression were used to analyse the relations of ODD dimensions/ODD subtypes to comorbid psychopathology and criminal reoffenses from official data. Results The ODD-irritable dimension, but not the ODD defiant/vindictive dimension predicted comorbid anxiety, suicidality and violent reoffending. LCA identified four subtypes, namely, a no-ODD subtype , a severe ODD subtype and two moderate ODD subtypes with either defiant or irritable symptoms. The irritable ODD subtype and the severe ODD subtype were related to suicidality and comorbid affective/anxiety disorders. The irritable ODD subtype was the strongest predictor of criminal (violent) reoffending even when controlling for CD. Conclusions The present findings confirm the presence of ODD dimensions/subtypes in a highly disturbed adolescent offender sample. Irritable youths were at risk of suicide and persistent criminal behaviours. Due to the severe consequences of irritability, a standardized assessment approach and a specific treatment is needed in prison to prevent suicide among the detainees and further harm to the society. As defined in the DSM-5, the present findings confirm the validity of ODD and ODD dimensions/subtypes as a diagnostic category among older youths.;,citation_author=Marcel Aebi;,citation_author=Steffen Barra;,citation_author=Cornelia Bessler;,citation_author=Hans-Christoph Steinhausen;,citation_author=Susanne Walitza;,citation_author=Belinda Plattner;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12473;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1111/jcpp.12473;,citation_issn=1469-7610;,citation_volume=57;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry;">

Editorial page 655 Related article page 705 Supplemental content at jamapsychiatry.com DESIGN, SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS The study sample was the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of 2232 twins born in England and Wales from January 1, 1994 , to December 4, 1995. Evaluation of childhood ADHD (ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 years) included prenatal and perinatal factors, clinical characteristics, and aspects of the family environment. Among participants aged 18 years, ADHD symptoms and associated impairment , overall functioning, and other mental health disorders were examined. Data analysis was conducted from February 19 to September 10, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria in childhood and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in young adulthood. RESULTS Of 2232 participants in the E-Risk Study, 2040 were included in the present analysis. In total, 247 individuals met diagnostic criteria for childhood ADHD; of these, 54 (21.9%) also met diagnostic criteria for the disorder at age 18 years. Persistence was associated with more symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04-1.19]) and lower IQ (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]). At age 18 years, individuals with persistent ADHD had more functional impairment (school/work: OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.18-5.00], home/with friends: OR, 6.26 [95% CI, 3.07-12.76]), generalized anxiety disorder (OR, 5.19 [95% CI, 2.01-13.38]), conduct disorder (OR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.03-3.99]), and marijuana dependence (OR, 2.88 [95% CI, 1.07-7.71]) compared with those whose ADHD remitted. Among 166 individuals with adult ADHD, 112 (67.5%) did not meet criteria for ADHD at any assessment in childhood. Results from logistic regressions indicated that individuals with late-onset ADHD showed fewer externalizing problems (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.96]) and higher IQ (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.07]) in childhood compared with the persistent group. However, at age 18 years, those with late-onset ADHD demonstrated comparable ADHD symptoms and impairment as well as similarly elevated rates of mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We identified heterogeneity in the DSM-5 young adult ADHD population such that this group consisted of a large, late-onset ADHD group with no childhood diagnosis, and a smaller group with persistent ADHD. The extent to which childhood-onset and late-onset adult ADHD may reflect different causes has implications for genetic studies and treatment of ADHD.;,citation_author=Jessica C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multimodal prognostic features of seizure freedom in epilepsy surgery;,citation_abstract=Objective Accurate preoperative predictions of seizure freedom following surgery for focal drug resistant epilepsy remain elusive. Our objective was to systematically evaluate all meta-­analyses of epilepsy surgery with seizure freedom as the primary outcome, to identify clinical features that are consistently prognostic and should be included in the future models. Methods We searched PubMed and Cochrane using free-­text and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-­Analyses. This study was registered on PROSPERO. We classified features as prognostic, non-­ prognostic and uncertain and into seven subcategories: ’clinical’, ’imaging’, ’neurophysiology’, ’multimodal concordance’, ’genetic’, ’surgical technique’ and ’pathology’. We propose a structural causal model based on these features. Results We found 46 features from 38 meta-­analyses over 22 years. The following were consistently prognostic across meta-­analyses: febrile convulsions, hippocampal sclerosis, focal abnormal MRI, Single-­Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) coregistered to MRI, focal ictal/interictal EEG, EEG-­MRI concordance, temporal lobe resections, complete excision, histopathological lesions, tumours and focal cortical dysplasia type IIb. Severe learning disability was predictive of poor prognosis. Others, including sex and side of resection, were non-­prognostic. There were limited meta-­analyses investigating genetic contributions, structural connectivity or multimodal concordance and few adjusted for known confounders or performed corrections for multiple comparisons. Significance  Seizure-­free outcomes have not improved over decades of epilepsy surgery and despite a multitude of models, none prognosticate accurately. Our list of multimodal population-i­nvariant prognostic features and proposed structural causal model may serve as an objective foundation for statistical adjustments of plausible confounders for use in high-­dimensional models.

Study design: A multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial was conducted across all tertiary neonatal hospitals in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were 91 extremely preterm/extremely low birth weight 7-year-old children born in Victoria in 2005. Children were randomly assigned to either the Cogmed or placebo arm and completed the Cogmed or placebo program (20-25 sessions of 35-40 minutes duration) at home over 5-7 weeks. Academic achievement (word reading, spelling, sentence comprehension, and mathematics) was assessed 24 months post-training, as well as at 2 weeks and 12 months post-training, via standardized testing inclusive of working memory, attention, and executive behavior assessments. Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach with mixed-effects modeling. Results: There was little evidence of any benefits of Cogmed on academic functioning 24 months post-training, as well as on working memory, attention, or executive behavior at any age up to 24 months post-training compared with the placebo program.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic structure of spatial and verbal working memory.;,citation_abstract=Working memory (WM) encompasses both short-term memory (storage) and executive functions that play an essential role in all forms of cognition. In this study, the genetic structure of storage and executive functions engaged in both a spatial and verbal WM span task is investigated using a twin sample. The sample consists of 143 monozygotic (MZ) and 93 dizygotic (DZ) Japanese twin pairs, ages 16 to 29 years. In 155 (87 MZ, 62 DZ) of these pairs, cognitive ability scores from the Kyodai Japanese IQ test are also obtained. The phenotypic relationship between WM and cognitive ability is confirmed (r = 0.26-0.44). Individual differences in WM storage and executive functions are found to be significantly influenced by genes, with heritability estimates all moderately high (43%-49%), and estimates for cognitive ability comparable to previous studies (65%). A large part of the genetic variance in storage and executive functions in both spatial and verbal modalities is due to a common genetic factor that accounts for 11% to 43% of the variance. In the reduced sample, this common genetic factor accounts for 64% and 26% of the variance in spatial and verbal cognitive ability, respectively. Additional genetic variance in WM (7%-30%) is due to modality specific factors (spatial and verbal) and a storage specific factor that may be particularly important for the verbal modality. None of the variance in cognitive ability is accounted for by the modality and storage genetic factors, suggesting these may be specific to WM.;,citation_author=Juko Ando;,citation_author=Yutaka Ono;,citation_author=Margaret J.

A meta-analysis of representative general population studies provides estimates of the strength of associations between pairs of disorders with narrower confidence intervals than have previously been available. Current evidence convincingly eliminates methodological factors as a major cause of comorbidity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reclaiming saliency: Rhythmic precision-modulated action and perception;,citation_abstract=Computational models of visual attention in artificial intelligence and robotics have been inspired by the concept of a saliency map. These models account for the mutual information between the (current) visual information and its estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality between perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to sample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimization and rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and salience with uncertainty minimization that underwrites the selection of future sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing numerical experiments that showcase its advantages for state and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path planning.;,citation_author=Ajith Anil Meera;,citation_author=Filip Novicky;,citation_author=Thomas Parr;,citation_author=Karl Friston;,citation_author=Pablo Lanillos;,citation_author=Noor Sajid;,citation_publication_date=2022-07-28;,citation_cover_date=2022-07-28;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.896229/full;,citation_doi=10.3389/fnbot.2022.896229;,citation_issn=1662-5218;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Front.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain;,citation_abstract=Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.;,citation_author=Verneri Anttila;,citation_author=Brendan Bulik-Sullivan;,citation_author=Hilary K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working memory, age and education: A lifespan fMRI study;,citation_abstract=Ageing is associated with grey matter atrophy and changes in task-related neural activations. This study investigated the effects of age and education on neural activation during a spatial working memory task in 189 participants aged between 20-80 years old, whilst controlling for grey matter density. Age was related to linear decreases in neural activation in task activated areas, and this effect was no longer significant when adjusting for education or accuracy. Age was also related to cubic increases in neural activation in non-task related areas, such as the temporal gyrus, cuneus and cerebellum when adjusting for accuracy and education. These findings support previous lifespan datasets indicating linear age-related decreases in task activation, but non-linear increases in non-task related areas during episodic memory tasks. The findings also support past studies indicating education offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing studies.;,citation_author=Jo A Archer;,citation_author=Annie Lee;,citation_author=Anqi Qiu;,citation_author=S-h H.Annabel Chen;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0194878;,citation_isbn=1111111111;,citation_issn=19326203;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=PLoS One;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Molecular influences on working memory circuits in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;,citation_abstract=The working memory circuits of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) are modulated in a unique manner, often opposite to the molecular mechanisms needed for long-term memory consolidation. Working memory, our “mental sketch pad” is an ephemeral process, whereby transient, mental representations form the foundation for abstract thought. The microcircuits that generate mental representations are found in deep layer III of the dlPFC, where pyramidal cells excite each other to keep information “in mind” through NMDA receptor synapses on spines. The catecholaminergic and cholinergic arousal systems have rapid and flexible influences on the strength of these connections, thus allowing coordination between arousal and cognitive states. These modulators can rapidly weaken connectivity, for example, as occurs during uncontrollable stress, via feedforward calcium–cAMP signaling opening potassium (K+) channels near synapses on spines. Lower levels of calcium–cAMP–K+ channel signaling provide negative feedback within recurrent excitatory circuits, and help to gate inputs to shape the contents of working memory. There are also explicit mechanisms to inhibit calcium–cAMP signaling and strengthen connectivity, for example, postsynaptic α2A-adrenoceptors on spines. This work has led to the development of the α2A agonist, guanfacine, for the treatment of a variety of dlPFC disorders. In mental illness, there are a variety of genetic insults to the molecules that normally serve to inhibit calcium–cAMP signaling in spines, thus explaining why so many genetic insults can lead to the same phenotype of impaired dlPFC cognitive function. Thus, the molecular mechanisms that provide mental flexibility may also confer vulnerability when dysregulated in cognitive disorders.;,citation_author=Amy F. T. Arnsten;,citation_author=Lu E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Building the foundation for genomics in precision medicine;,citation_abstract=Precision medicine has the potential to profoundly improve the practice of medicine. However, the advances required will take time to implement. Genetics is already being used to direct clinical decision-making and its contribution is likely to increase.

Verbal memory is typically studied using immediate recall (IR) and delayed recall (DR) scores, although DR is dependent on IR capability. Separating these components may be useful for deciphering the genetic variation in age-related memory abilities. This study was conducted to (a) construct individual trajectories in IR and independent aspects of delayed recall, or residualized-DR (rDR), across older adulthood; and (b) identify genetic markers that contribute to four estimated phenotypes: IR and rDR levels and changes after age 60. A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of adults aged 50 and older. Mixed effects regression models were constructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (1996–2012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) were conducted in the genotypic subsample (N = 7,486) using ∼1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One SNP (rs2075650) in TOMM40 associated with rDR level at the genome-wide level (p = 5.0x10 -08 ), an effect that replicated in an independent sample from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (N = 6,898 with 41,328 observations). Meta-analysis of rDR level confirmed the association (p = 5.0x10 -11 ) and identified two others in TOMM40 (rs71352238 p = 1.0x10 -10 ; rs157582 p = 7.0x10 -09 ), and one in APOE (rs7694 49 p = 3.1 x10 -12 ). Meta-analysis of IR change identified associations with three of the same SNPs in TOMM40 (rs157582 p = 8.3x10 -10 ; rs71352238 p = 1.9x10 -09 ) and APOE (rs769449 p = 2.2x10 -08 ). Conditional analyses indicate GWAS signals on rDR level were driven by APOE, whereas signals on IR change were driven by TOMM40. Additionally, we found that TOMM40 had effects independent of APOE e4 on both phenotypes. Findings from this first U.S. population-based GWAS study conducted on both age-related immediate and delayed verbal memory merit continued examination in other samples and additional measures of verbal memory.;,citation_author=Thalida E.

How sleep subserves human dreaming—rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—is especially puzzling. There is considerable mechanistic understanding of the synaptic, cellular, and circuit bases of REM sleep ( 2 , 3 ). However, despite pharmacological evidence that dopamine (DA) can potently modulate REM sleep, this neurotransmitter is conspicuously absent from most prevailing REM sleep circuit models. DA is historically associated with pleasure and addiction. On page 994 of this issue Hasegawa et al. ( 4 ) report that the release of DA in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain structure associated with emotional processing, can trigger REM sleep in mice and also that selective manipulation of DA release within the BLA can trigger cataplexy, which occurs in the sleep disorder narcolepsy and manifests as a crippling pathologic intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness that results in loss of postural motor control.;,citation_author=Elda Arrigoni;,citation_author=Patrick M.

Small effect sizes (d\textless0.5) were found for visuoperception. In first-degree relatives, effect sizes were small (d\ textless0.5), but significantly different from healthy controls for executive function and verbal memory in particular.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A comparison of methods to estimate cross-environment genetic correlations;,citation_abstract=Advanced techniques for quantitative genetic parameter estimation may not always be necessary to answer broad genetic questions. However, simpler methods are often biased, and the extent of this determines their usefulness. In this study we compare family mean correlations to least squares and restricted error maximum likelihood (REML) variance component approaches to estimating cross-environment genetic correlations. We analysed empirical data from studies where both types of estimates were made, and from studies in our own laboratories. We found that the agreement between estimates was better when full-sib rather than half-sib estimates of cross-environment genetic correlations were used and when mean family size increased. We also note biases in REML estimation that may be especially important when testing to see if correlations differ from 0 or 1. We conclude that correlations calculated from family means can be used to test for the presence of genetic correlations across environments, which is sufficient for some research questions. Variance component approaches should be used when parameter estimation is the objective, or if the goal is anything other than determining broad patterns. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.;,citation_author=P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Network-wise surface-based morphometric insight into the cortical neural circuitry underlying irritability in adolescents;,citation_abstract=Abstract Previous studies examining structural brain correlates of irritability have taken a region-specific approach and have been relatively inconsistent. In a sample of adolescents with and without clinically impairing irritability, the current study examines: (i) cortical volume (CV) in canonical functional networks; (ii) the association between the CV of functional networks and severity of irritability; and (iii) the extent to which IQ mediates the association between structural abnormalities and severity of irritability. Structural MRI and IQ data were collected from 130 adolescents with high irritability (mean age = 15.54±1.83 years, 58 females, self-reported Affective Reactivity Index [ARI] ≥ 4) and 119 adolescents with low irritability (mean age = 15.10±1.93 years, 39 females, self-reported ARI $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 4). Subject-specific network-wise CV was estimated after parcellating the whole brain into 17 previously reported functional networks. Our Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) revealed that adolescents with high irritability had significantly reduced CV of the bilateral control and default-mode networks ( p  $&amp;lt;$ 0.05) relative to adolescents with low irritability. Multiple regression analyses showed a significant negative association between the control network CV and the severity of irritability. Mediation analysis showed that IQ partially mediated the association between the control network CV and the severity of irritability. Follow-up analysis on subcortical volume (SCV) showed that adolescents with high irritability had reduced bilateral SCV within the amygdala relative to adolescents with low irritability. Reduced CV within bilateral control and default networks and reduced SCV within bilateral amygdala may represent core features of the pathophysiology of irritability. The current data also indicate the potential importance of a patient’s IQ in determining how pathophysiology related to the control network is expressed.;,citation_author=Sahil Bajaj;,citation_author=Karina S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive impairments in psychotic disorders: Common mechanisms and measurement;,citation_abstract=Decades of research have provided robust evidence of cognitive impairments in psychotic disorders. Individuals with schizophrenia appear to be impaired on the majority of neuropsychological tasks, leading some researchers to argue for a &amp;amp;amp;quot;generalized deficit&amp;quot;, in which the multitude of cognitive impairments are the result of a common neurobiological source. One such common mechanism may be an inability to actively represent goal information in working memory as a means to guide behavior, with the associated neurobiological impairment being a disturbance in the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, we provide a discussion of the evidence for such impairment in schizophrenia, and how it manifests in domains typically referred to as cognitive control, working memory and episodic memory. We also briefly discuss cognitive impairment in affective psychoses, reporting that the degree of impairment is worse in schizophrenia than in bipolar disorder and psychotic major depression, but the profile of impairment is similar, possibly reflecting common mechanisms at the neural level.

This study uses 128-channel EEG to assess whether asymmetry of interhemispheric transfer found in normal individuals is present in those with schizophrenia, and whether this might point to a right-hemisphere dysfunction. Methods: Simple reaction time (RT) was recorded to stimuli presented to the left visual field (LVF), right visual field (RVF) or bilaterally (BVF) in 13 males with schizophrenia and 13 controls. 128-Channel EEG was simultaneously recorded. Interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) in each direction was calculated by comparing the latencies of N160 EP components in the hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to stimulation. Results: While controls showed faster information transfer from the right-to-left hemisphere, this asymmetry was not present in the schizophrenia group who also exhibited a concomitant decrease in the amplitude of the N160 in the right hemisphere. Conclusions: Results are interpreted with reference to a loss of rapidly conducting myelinated axons in the right hemisphere in schizophrenia. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender-specific effects of the catechol-O-methyltransferase Val108 /158Met polymorphism on cognitive function in children.;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the cognitive effect of the Val108/158Met polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in children before and during puberty. This polymorphism affects cognitive function in healthy adults and may contribute to risk for schizophrenia. METHOD: COMT genotype was determined for 8,707 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a geographically defined general population cohort of children born between April 1, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1992, in the southwest of England. Fourteen measures of cognitive function–including working memory, verbal and motor inhibition, attentional control, and IQ–were assessed at ages 8 and 10 years. Any pubertal development at age 9 years was reported by parents. Effects of COMT genotype on cognition and interactions with gender and puberty were assessed using general linear models. RESULTS: In boys, genotype significantly affected executive function and explained up to 10 points normal variation in verbal IQ. The effects on IQ were significantly greater in pubertal than in prepubertal boys. In girls, there were no significant effects of genotype on cognition. CONCLUSIONS: This common polymorphism may be one of the genes of small effect that contribute to normal variation in IQ. The gender-specific nature of the effect and its possible interaction with puberty may be relevant to both normal cognitive and brain development and to abnormal development in disorders such as schizophrenia.;,citation_author=Jennifer H Barnett;,citation_author=Jon Heron;,citation_author=Susan M Ring;,citation_author=Jean Golding;,citation_author=David Goldman;,citation_author=Ke Xu;,citation_author=Peter B Jones;,citation_publication_date=2007-01;,citation_cover_date=2007-01;,citation_year=2007;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17202556;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.1.142;,citation_issn=0002-953X;,citation_volume=164;,citation_journal_title=Am.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive deficit in preschoolers born late-preterm;,citation_abstract=Background: Late-preterm (LPT) birth accounts for a majority of preterm deliveries and until recently was considered low risk for poor cognitive outcome. Previously, we reported deficits in complicated LPT (cLPT) preschoolers (neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]-admitted). Aim: To extend our prior study by comparing cognitive outcome in cLPT and uncomplicated LPT (uLPT; NICU non-admitted) preschoolers. Study design: Single center retrospective cohort study of 118 LPT children born in 2004–2006 at 35–36weeks of gestation; 90 cLPT and 28 uLPT, compared with 100 term-born (≥37weeks of gestation and ≥2500g) participants. Outcome measure: A well-standardized measure of general conceptual ability (GCA), the Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition. Results: cLPT participants had average mean performances but significantly poorer GCA, Nonverbal Reasoning, and Spatial scores than term-born children, and higher rates of Nonverbal Reasoning and Spatial impairment; uLPT did not differ from TERM. Combined LPT males were at eightfold greater risk than term-born males for nonverbal deficit, and at sevenfold greater risk for GCA impairment than LPT females. Conclusions: Finding greater risk of cognitive deficit in those NICU-admitted due to clinical instability or birth weight  $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$2kg compared with non-admitted preschoolers indicates that neonatal morbidities contribute to subtle cognitive deficits detectable at young age, with male gender an additive risk factor. LPT gestational age alone is an insufficient predictor of long-term neurocognitive outcome. Further study should elucidate salient etiologies for early emerging cognitive weaknesses and suggest appropriate interventions to prepare at-risk LPT preschoolers for elementary school entry.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Common genetic variants on 6q24 associated with exceptional episodic memory performance in the elderly;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: There are genetic influences on memory ability as we age, but no specific genes have been identified. OBJECTIVE: To use a cognitive endophenotype, exceptional episodic memory (EEM) performance, derived from nondemented offspring from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS) to identify genetic variants that may be responsible for the high cognitive performance of LLFS participants and further replicate these variants using an additional 4006 nondemented individuals from 4 independent elderly cohorts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 467 LLFS participants from 18 families with 2 or more offspring that exhibited exceptional memory performance were used for genome-wide linkage analysis. Adjusted multivariate linear analyses in the 40-megabase region encompassing the linkage peak were conducted using 4 independent replication data sets that included 4006 nondemented elderly individuals. Results of the individual replication cohorts were combined by meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Episodic memory scores computed as the mean of the 2 standardized measures of Logical Memory IA and IIA. RESULTS: Heritability estimates indicated a significant genetic component for EEM (h2 = 0.21; SE = 0.09). Genome-wide linkage analysis revealed that EEM was linked to the 6q24 region (maximum logarithm of odds score, 3.64). Association analysis in LLFS families identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) nominally associated with EEM in the 40-megabase window encompassing the linkage peak. Replication in one cohort identified a set of 26 SNPs associated with episodic memory (P \textless/= .05). Meta-analysis of the 26 SNPs using the 4 independent replication cohorts found SNPs rs9321334 and rs6902875 to be nominally significantly associated with episodic memory (P = .009 and P = .013, respectively). With meta-analysis restricted to individuals lacking an APOE epsilon4 allele, SNP rs6902875 became statistically significant (meta-analysis, P = 6.7 x 10-5). Haplotype analysis incorporating the 2 SNPs flanking rs6902875 (rs9321334 and rs4897574) revealed that the A-A-C haplotype was significantly associated with episodic memory performance (P = 2.4 x 10-5). This genomic region harbors monooxygenase dopamine beta-hydroxylase-like 1 gene (MOXD1), implicated in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine, which is prominently involved in cognitive functions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results provide strong evidence for potential candidate genes related to EEM on 6q24. Identifying the genes will help in understanding the biological basis of memory performance and allow interventions for enhancement of cognitive function.;,citation_author=Sandra Barral;,citation_author=Stephanie Cosentino;,citation_author=Kaare Christensen;,citation_author=Anne B Newman;,citation_author=Thomas T Perls;,citation_author=Michael A Province;,citation_author=Richard Mayeux;,citation_publication_date=2014-12;,citation_cover_date=2014-12;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working memory in siblings of schizophrenia patients;,citation_abstract=Working memory (WM) has hardly been explored in non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenic patients despite its potential suitability as a neurocognitive endophenotype. Indeed, WM modalities, components and processes have rarely been compared in the same group of relatives. The present study examined neurocognitive performance in healthy siblings of schizophrenic patients, including both spatial and verbal WM modalities and tests tapping maintenance (Spatial Span Backwards and CPT-IP d′) and manipulative (Letters and Numbers Sequencing) WM processes. METHODS 68 schizophrenia patients, 38 healthy siblings and 63 controls were assessed on IQ, attention, memory, WM, and executive functions. Cluster A symptoms were screened out in siblings and controls. RESULTS Siblings had an intermediate performance between that of schizophrenic patients and controls. They performed worse than controls on IQ, LNS, animal naming, backwards spatial span, phonemic fluency, numbers d′, and forward spatial span. DISCUSSION Consistent with the WM literature in schizophrenia, both verbal and spatial WM differed significantly between siblings and controls, suggesting that WM deficits are modality independent. Our results failed to support the hypothesis that tests tapping WM manipulative processes heavily loading on DLFPC are quantitatively more impaired in relatives and, therefore, more sensitive to liability for schizophrenia. However, firm conclusions cannot be drawn until more studies assessing both maintenance and manipulative WM processes in relatives are available.;,citation_author=Neus Barrantes-Vidal;,citation_author=Mari Aguilera;,citation_author=Sílvia Campanera;,citation_author=Mar Fatjó-Vilas;,citation_author=Marc Guitart;,citation_author=Salvador Miret;,citation_author=Sergi Valero;,citation_author=Lourdes Fañanás;,citation_publication_date=2007-09;,citation_cover_date=2007-09;,citation_year=2007;,citation_fulltext_html_url=

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cerebral networks of sustained attention and working memory: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study based on the Continuous Performance Test.;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION One of the most used paradigms in the study of attention is the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). The identical pairs version (CPT-IP) has been widely used to evaluate attention deficits in developmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the specific locations and the relative distribution of brain activation in networks identified with functional imaging, varies significantly with differences in task design. AIM To design a task to evaluate sustained attention using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and thus to provide data for research concerned with the role of these functions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty right-handed, healthy students (50% women; age range: 18-25 years) were recruited. A CPT-IP implemented as a block design was used to assess sustained attention during the fMRI session. RESULTS The behavioural results from the CPT-IP task showed a good performance in all subjects, higher than 80% of hits. fMRI results showed that the used CPT-IP task activates a network of frontal, parietal and occipital areas, and that these are related to executive and attentional functions. CONCLUSIONS In relation to the use of the CPT to study of attention and working memory, this task provides normative data in healthy adults, and it could be useful to evaluate disorders which have attentional and working memory deficits.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining epileptogenic networks: Contribution of SEEG and signal analysis;,citation_abstract=Epileptogenic networks are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. In this review we describe the historical, methodologic, and conceptual bases of this model in the analysis of electrophysiologic intracerebral recordings. In the context of epilepsy surgery, the determination of cerebral regions producing seizures (i.e., the “epileptogenic zone”) is a crucial objective. In contrast with a traditional focal vision of focal drug-resistant epilepsies, the concept of epileptogenic networks has been progressively introduced as a model better able to describe the complexity of seizure dynamics and realistically describe the distribution of epileptogenic anomalies in the brain. The concept of epileptogenic networks is historically linked to the development of the stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method and subsequent introduction of means of quantifying the recorded signals. Seizures , and preictal and interictal discharges produce clear patterns on SEEG. These patterns can be analyzed utilizing signal analysis methods that quantify high-frequency oscillations or changes in functional connectivity. Dramatic changes in SEEG brain connectivity can be described during seizure genesis and propagation within cortical and subcortical regions, associated with the production of different patterns of seizure semiology. The interictal state is characterized by networks generating abnormal activities (interictal spikes) and also by modified functional properties. The introduction of novel approaches to large-scale modeling of these networks offers new methods in the goal of better predicting the effects of epilepsy surgery. The epileptogenic network concept is a key factor in identifying the anatomic distribution of the epileptogenic process, which is particularly important in the context of epilepsy surgery.;,citation_author=Fabrice Bartolomei;,citation_author=Stanislas Lagarde;,citation_author=Fabrice Wendling;,citation_author=Aileen McGonigal;,citation_author=Viktor Jirsa;,citation_author=Maxime Guye;,citation_author=Christian Bénar;,citation_publication_date=2017-07;,citation_cover_date=2017-07;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.13791;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1111/epi.13791;,citation_issn=00139580;,citation_volume=58;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Epilepsia;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive–affective factors underlying disinhibitory disorders and legal implications;,citation_abstract=Disinhibited behaviours such as aggression, criminality and substance misuse are ubiquitous.

These behaviours are widespread, but more commonly exhibited by individuals with specific psychological problems, namely disorders characterized by disinhibition. Although individuals with disinhibitory disorders display similar behaviours, the underlying cognitive–affective factors are distinct and must be taken into account when developing scientifically informed interventions. In this Review, we provide a summary of key cognitive–affective factors associated with four disinhibitory disorders: substance use disorders, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy. We focus on these four disorders given their phenotypic overlap and because individuals with these disorders disproportionately find themselves ensnared in the legal system. We discuss the implications of integrating an understanding of cognitive–affective functioning for more successful interactions between individuals with these disorders and the police, courts and correctional facilities. To protect all members of society, we must consider how psychological science can have a greater role at various stages of legal intervention.;,citation_author=Arielle Baskin-Sommers;,citation_author=Sonia Ruiz;,citation_author=Brianna Sarcos;,citation_author=Cortney Simmons;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00020-8;,citation_issue=3, 3;,citation_doi=10.1038/s44159-022-00020-8;,citation_issn=2731-0574;,citation_volume=1;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nat Rev Psychol;,citation_publisher=Nature Publishing Group;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differences in brain morphology and working memory capacity across childhood;,citation_abstract=© 2017 The Authors. Developmental Science Published by John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons Ltd. Working memory (WM) skills are closely associated with learning progress in key areas such as reading and mathematics across childhood. As yet, however, little is known about how the brain systems underpinning WM develop over this critical developmental period. The current study investigated whether and how structural brain correlates of components of the working memory system change over development. Verbal and visuospatial short-term and working memory were assessed in 153 children between 5.58 and 15.92 years, and latent components of the working memory system were derived. Fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness maps were derived from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI and processed using eigenanatomy decomposition. There was a greater involvement of the corpus callosum and posterior temporal white matter in younger children for performance associated with the executive part of the working memory system. For older children, this was more closely linked with the thickness of the occipitotemporal cortex. These findings suggest that increasing specialization leads to shifts in the contribution of neural substrates over childhood, moving from an early dependence on a distributed system supported by long-range connections to later reliance on specialized local circuitry. Our findings demonstrate that despite the component factor structure being stable across childhood, the underlying brain systems supporting working memory change. Taking the age of the child into account, and not just their overall score, is likely to be critical for understanding the nature of the limitations on their working memory capacity.;,citation_author=Joe Bathelt;,citation_author=Susan E Gathercole;,citation_author=Amy Johnson;,citation_author=Duncan E Astle;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/desc.12579;,citation_issn=14677687;,citation_volume=21;,citation_journal_title=Dev.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Communication is key: The utility of a revised neuropsychological report format;,citation_abstract=Objective: The neuropsychological report is a critical tool for communicating evaluation results to multiple audiences who have varying knowledge about neuropsychology and often have limited ability to review long, complex reports. Considerable time is spent writing these reports and challenges persist related to readability , length/complexity, and billable clinical time (which may be capped by third-party payors or families’ability to pay). Methods: This quality improvement effort systematically evaluated the redesign of pediatric neuropsychological reports in an outpatient clinic serving primarily medical populations. Results: Revised reports were shorter, with improved readability, structure, and effectiveness in communicating results and recommendations. Improved clinical efficiency was also observed. Conclusions: We suggest that adaptation to efficient, readable, and effective reports is possible within the practice of neuropsychology. Findings encourage replication in other settings. Through collaboration with key stakeholders, providers can identify their populations’and audience’s unique needs and set report targets accordingly. To encourage that practice, we summarize our general process, provide a set of guidelines that can be adapted across multiple settings, and include an appended sample report.;,citation_author=Katherine T Baum;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Parent Training for Children with Disruptive Behaviors: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of  Randomized Trials;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Digital-based parent training (DPT) programs for parents of children with disruptive behaviors have been developed and tested in randomized trials. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the efficacy of these programs versus a control condition. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of peer-reviewed randomized studies comparing DPT targeting children with disruptive behaviors versus a control group (wait list or no treatment). Results: Altogether, seven studies (n = 718) were meta-analyzed. Compared to the control groups, DPT resulted in significantly greater improvement in child behavior (effect size [ES] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.21–0.66, studies = 7), parent behavior (ES = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.25–0.57, studies = 6), and parental confidence (ES = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.12–0.59, studies = 4). The improvement in child behavior was moderated by age group and severity of clinical presentation, which overlapped 100%. While DPT was superior to control conditions in studies of young children (mean age $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$7 years) with a clinical range of disruptive behaviors (ES = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.40–0.82, studies = 4), results were nonsignificant in studies of older children (mean age $&amp;gt;$11 years) with a nonclinical range of symptoms (ES = 0.21, 95% CI = -0.01 to 0.42, studies = 3). Analyses yielded similar results of higher ESs favoring studies of young children with clinical range disruptive behaviors for parent behavior and parental confidence, but the differences were not significant. Results further suggested that in studies of younger children, interactive programs (e.g., computerized programs) were more effective in improving child behavior compared to noninteractive programs (e.g., watching video clips) ( p $&amp;lt;$ 0.05).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Technology-Assisted Parent Training Programs for Children and Adolescents With Disruptive Behaviors: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=Objective: To systematically review digitally assisted parent training programs (DPTs) targeting the treatment of children and adolescents with disruptive behaviors. Data Sources: A search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2016. Reference lists of included and review articles were searched manually for additional references. Study Selection: Broad search terms in varying combinations for parent, training, technologies, and disruptive behavior problems were used. We included English-language articles reporting on the effectiveness of DPTs targeting child or adolescent disruptive behaviors (eg, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder). DPTs designed to use digital media or software programs not to be primarily used within a therapy setting (eg, group, face-to-face) were included. Data Extraction: Study design, recruitment and sample characteristics, theoretical background, digital program features, user’s engagement, and measures of child behavior were extracted. Results: Fourteen intervention studies (n = 2,427, 58% male, 1, 500 in DPT conditions, 12 randomized trials) examining 10 programs met inclusion criteria. Interventions included self-directed noninteractive (eg, podcasts; 3 studies) and interactive (eg, online software; 4 studies) DPTs, remotely administered DPTs combined with professional phone-based coaching (2 studies), and a smartphone enhancement of standard treatment. Interventions were delivered over a mean ± SD period of 8.7 ± 4.2 weeks, most (11/14; 78.6%) were remotely administered, and all recruitment procedures included an outreach for parents outside of mental health–care settings. For programs with $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 5 sessions, the mean  ± SD completion rate of available sessions was 68.6% ± 13.1% . In comparison to no treatment control, self-directed programs yielded significant improvements in child behavior for children (age $&amp;lt;$ 9 years, Cohen d = 0.47–0.80, 4 studies) and adolescents (d = 0.17, 0.20, 2 studies). Overall, reduced professional support combined with DPT was not inferior to full-contact conditions and showed small improvement in comparison to usual care (d = 0.34). Preliminary indicators also suggested that technology enhancements may increase engagement and outcomes of standard treatment. Conclusions: The current review indicates the efficacy of DPT across a range of therapy formats applied in real-world settings demonstrating the potential for increased accessibility of evidence-based treatment for youth with disruptive behaviors. Additional studies are needed to extend these findings and to determine moderating effects of different designs.

Method: Here, we review the latest developments in the genomics of cognition, including a discussion of methodological advances in the genetic analysis of complex traits, and shared genetic contributions to cognitive abilities and neuropsychiatric disorders. Results: A wealth of twin and family studies have provided compelling evidence for a strong heritable component of both global and specific cognitive abilities, and for the existence of &amp;amp;amp;quot;generalist genes&amp;quot; responsible for a large portion of the variance in diverse cognitive abilities. Increasingly sophisticated analytic tools and ever-larger sample sizes are now facilitating the identification of specific genetic and molecular underpinnings of cognitive abilities, leading to optimism regarding possibilities for novel treatments for illnesses related to cognitive function. Conclusions: We conclude with a set of future directions for the field, which will further accelerate discoveries regarding the biological pathways relevant to cognitive abilities. These, in turn , may be further interrogated in order to link biological mechanisms to behavior.;,citation_author=Carrie E. Bearden;,citation_author=David C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Electrocorticography and stereo EEG provide distinct measures of brain connectivity: Implications for network models;,citation_abstract=Abstract Brain network models derived from graph theory have the potential to guide functional neurosurgery, and to improve rates of post-operative seizure freedom for patients with epilepsy. A barrier to applying these models clinically is that intracranial EEG electrode implantation strategies vary by centre, region and country, from cortical grid &amp;amp;amp; strip electrodes (Electrocorticography), to purely stereotactic depth electrodes (Stereo EEG), to a mixture of both. To determine whether models derived from one type of study are broadly applicable to others, we investigate the differences in brain networks mapped by electrocorticography and stereo EEG in a cohort of patients who underwent surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy and achieved a favourable outcome. We show that networks derived from electrocorticography and stereo EEG define distinct relationships between resected and spared tissue, which may be driven by sampling bias of temporal depth electrodes in patients with predominantly cortical grids. We propose a method of correcting for the effect of internodal distance that is specific to electrode type and explore how additional methods for spatially correcting for sampling bias affect network models. Ultimately, we find that smaller surgical targets tend to have lower connectivity with respect to the surrounding network, challenging notions that abnormal connectivity in the epileptogenic zone is typically high. Our findings suggest that effectively applying computational models to localize epileptic networks requires accounting for the effects of spatial sampling, particularly when analysing both electrocorticography and stereo EEG recordings in the same cohort, and that future network studies of epilepsy surgery should also account for differences in focality between resection and ablation. We propose that these findings are broadly relevant to intracranial EEG network modelling in epilepsy and an important step in translating them clinically into patient care.;,citation_author=John M Bernabei;,citation_author=T Campbell Arnold;,citation_author=Preya Shah;,citation_author=Andrew Revell;,citation_author=Ian Z Ong;,citation_author=Lohith G Kini;,citation_author=Joel M Stein;,citation_author=Russell T Shinohara;,citation_author=Timothy H Lucas;,citation_author=Kathryn A Davis;,citation_author=Danielle S Bassett;,citation_author=Brian Litt;,citation_publication_date=2021-07-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-07-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=

Several lines of evidence are beginning to elucidate different variants of uncertainty. Particularly, risk, ambiguity, and expected and unexpected forms of uncertainty are well articulated in the literature. In this article we review both empirical and theoretical evidence arguing for the potential distinction between three forms of uncertainty; expected uncertainty, unexpected uncertainty, and volatility. Particular attention will be devoted to exploring the distinction between unexpected uncertainty and volatility which has been less appreciated in the literature. This includes evidence mainly from neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and electrophysiological studies. We further address the possible differentiation of cognitive control mechanisms used to deal with these forms of uncertainty. Finally, we explore whether the dual modes of control theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding the distinction between unexpected uncertainty and volatility.;,citation_author=Amy R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic effects on the cerebellar role in working memory: Same brain, different genes?;,citation_abstract=Over the past several years, evidence has accumulated showing that the cerebellum plays a significant role in cognitive function. Here we show, in a large genetically informative twin sample (n= 430; aged 16-30. years), that the cerebellum is strongly, and reliably (n=30 rescans), activated during an n-back working memory task, particularly lobules I-IV, VIIa Crus I and II, IX and the vermis. Monozygotic twin correlations for cerebellar activation were generally much larger than dizygotic twin correlations, consistent with genetic influences. Structural equation models showed that up to 65% of the variance in cerebellar activation during working memory is genetic (averaging 34% across significant voxels), most prominently in the lobules VI, and VIIa Crus I, with the remaining variance explained by unique/unshared environmental factors. Heritability estimates for brain activation in the cerebellum agree with those found for working memory activation in the cerebral cortex, even though cerebellar cyto-architecture differs substantially. Phenotypic correlations between BOLD percent signal change in cerebrum and cerebellum were low, and bivariate modeling indicated that genetic influences on the cerebellum are at least partly specific to the cerebellum. Activation on the voxel-level correlated very weakly with cerebellar gray matter volume, suggesting specific genetic influences on the BOLD signal. Heritable signals identified here should facilitate discovery of genetic polymorphisms influencing cerebellar function through genome-wide association studies, to elucidate the genetic liability to brain disorders affecting the cerebellum. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Gabriëlla A.

The Genetics of Endophenotypes of Neurofunction to Understand Schizophrenia (GENUS) Consortium aims to clarify the role of genetic variation in brain abnormalities underlying schizophrenia. This article describes the GENUS Consortium sample collection. Methods: We identified existing samples collected for schizophrenia studies consisting of patients, controls, and/ or individuals at familial high-risk (FHR) for schizophrenia. Samples had single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data or genomic DNA, clinical and demographic data, and neuropsychological and/or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Data were subjected to quality control procedures at a central site. Results: Sixteen research groups contributed data from 5199 psychosis patients, 4877 controls, and 725 FHR individuals. All participants have relevant demographic data and all patients have relevant clinical data. The sex ratio is 56.5% male and 43.5% female. Significant differences exist between diagnostic groups for premorbid and current IQ (both p b 1 × 10−10). Data from a diversity of neuropsychological tests are available for 92% of participants, and 30% have structural MRI scans (half also have diffusion-weighted MRI scans). SNP data are available for 76% of participants. The ancestry composition is 70% European, 20% East Asian, 7% African, and 3% other.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genome-wide association study of working memory brain activation;,citation_abstract=In a population-based genome-wide association (GWA) study of n-back working memory task-related brain activation, we extracted the average percent BOLD signal change (2-back minus 0-back) from 46 regions-of-interest (ROIs) in functional MRI scans from 863 healthy twins and siblings. ROIs were obtained by creating spheres around group random effects analysis local maxima, and by thresholding a voxel-based heritability map of working memory brain activation at 50%. Quality control for test-retest reliability and heritability of ROI measures yielded 20 reliable (r\ textgreater0.7) and heritable (h2\textgreater20%) ROIs. For GWA analysis, the cohort was divided into a discovery (n=679) and replication (n=97) sample. No variants survived the stringent multiple-testing-corrected genome-wide significance threshold (p\textless4.5×10−9), or were replicated (p \textless0.0016), but several genes were identified that are worthy of further investigation. A search of 529,379 genomic markers resulted in discovery of 31 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BOLD signal change at a discovery level of p\textless1×10−5. Two SNPs (rs7917410 and rs7672408) were associated at a significance level of p\textless1×10−7. Only one, most strongly affecting BOLD signal change in the left supramarginal gyrus (R2=5.5%), had multiple SNPs associated at p\ textless1×10−5 in linkage disequilibrium with it, all located in and around the BANK1 gene. BANK1 encodes a B-cell-specific scaffold protein and has been shown to negatively regulate CD40-mediated AKT activation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Heritability of neuropsychological measures in schizophrenia and nonpsychiatric populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.;,citation_abstract=Schizophrenia is characterized by neuropsychological deficits across many cognitive domains. Cognitive phenotypes with high heritability and genetic overlap with schizophrenia liability can help elucidate the mechanisms leading from genes to psychopathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 170 published twin and family heritability studies of \textgreater800 000 nonpsychiatric and schizophrenia subjects to accurately estimate heritability across many neuropsychological tests and cognitive domains. The proportion of total variance of each phenotype due to additive genetic effects (A), shared environment (C), and unshared environment and error (E), was calculated by averaging A, C, and E estimates across studies and weighting by sample size. Heritability ranged across phenotypes, likely due to differences in genetic and environmental effects, with the highest heritability for General Cognitive Ability (32%-67%), Verbal Ability (43%-72%), Visuospatial Ability (20%-80%), and Attention/Processing Speed (28%-74%), while the lowest heritability was observed for Executive Function (20%-40%). These results confirm that many cognitive phenotypes are under strong genetic influences. Heritability estimates were comparable in nonpsychiatric and schizophrenia samples, suggesting that environmental factors and illness-related moderators (eg, medication) do not substantially decrease heritability in schizophrenia samples, and that genetic studies in schizophrenia samples are informative for elucidating the genetic basis of cognitive deficits. Substantial genetic overlap between cognitive phenotypes and schizophrenia liability (average rg = -.58) in twin studies supports partially shared genetic etiology. It will be important to conduct comparative studies in well-powered samples to determine whether the same or different genes and genetic variants influence cognition in schizophrenia patients and the general population.;,citation_author=Gabriëlla A M Blokland;,citation_author=Raquelle I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Heritability of working memory brain activation.;,citation_abstract=Although key to understanding individual variation in task-related brain activation, the genetic contribution to these individual differences remains largely unknown. Here we report voxel-by-voxel genetic model fitting in a large sample of 319 healthy, young adult , human identical and fraternal twins (mean ± SD age, 23.6 ± 1.8 years) who performed an n-back working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at a high magnetic field (4 tesla). Patterns of task-related brain response (BOLD signal difference of 2-back minus 0-back) were significantly heritable, with the highest estimates (40-65%) in the inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri, left supplementary motor area, precentral and postcentral gyri, middle cingulate cortex, superior medial gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, including precuneus, and superior occipital gyri. Furthermore, high test-retest reliability for a subsample of 40 twins indicates that nongenetic variance in the fMRI brain response is largely due to unique environmental influences rather than measurement error. Individual variations in activation of the working memory network are therefore significantly influenced by genetic factors. By establishing the heritability of cognitive brain function in a large sample that affords good statistical power, and using voxel-by-voxel analyses, this study provides the necessary evidence for task-related brain activation to be considered as an endophenotype for psychiatric or neurological disorders, and represents a substantial new contribution to the field of neuroimaging genetics.

We review recent studies that show SAT is modulated in association and pre-motor areas rather than in sensory or primary motor areas. Furthermore, the studies suggest that emphasis on response speed increases the baseline firing rate of cortical integrator neurons. We also review current theories on how and where in the brain the SAT is controlled, and we end by proposing research directions that could distinguish between these theories. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We recruited 134 children and their parents (38.06% female; M age = 9.52 years, range = 7–14; 83.58% White). Families were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: Parent Management Training (PMT) and Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS). We formed principal components from pretreatment reports and behaviors of the parent–child relationship to predict within- and between-family outcomes in children’s externalizing problems and adaptive skills. Four principal components were supported (parental warmth, parental monitoring, family hostility, and family permissiveness). Parental monitoring predicted fewer externalizing problems, whereas family permissiveness predicted more externalizing problems. Parental warmth predicted greatest improvements in children’s adaptive skills among families receiving PMT. Family hostility predicted more externalizing problems and poorer adaptive skills for children; however, families receiving CPS were buffered from the negative effect of family hostility on adaptive skills. The parent–child relationship can uniquely inform posttreatment outcomes following treatment for oppositional defiant disorder. Certain treatment approaches may better fit unique relationships that emphasize warmth and/or hostility, allowing clinicians to anticipate and tailor treatments to families.;,citation_author=Jordan A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A flexible model of working memory;,citation_abstract=Working memory is fundamental to cognition, allowing one to hold information “in mind.” A defining characteristic of working memory is its flexibility: we can hold anything in mind. However, typical models of working memory rely on finely tuned, content-specific attractors to persistently maintain neural activity and therefore do not allow for the flexibility observed in behavior. Here, we present a flexible model of working memory that maintains representations through random recurrent connections between two layers of neurons: a structured “sensory” layer and a randomly connected, unstructured layer. As the interactions are untuned with respect to the content being stored, the network maintains any arbitrary input. However, in our model, this flexibility comes at a cost: the random connections overlap, leading to interference between representations and limiting the memory capacity of the network. Additionally, our model captures several other key behavioral and neurophysiological characteristics of working memory.;,citation_author=Flora Bouchacourt;,citation_author=Timothy J Buschman;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.020;,citation_issn=10974199;,citation_volume=103;,citation_journal_title=Neuron;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Inc.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The genetic relationship between handedness and neurodevelopmental disorders;,citation_abstract=Handedness and brain asymmetry have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia and schizophrenia. The genetic nature of this correlation is not understood. Recent discoveries have shown handedness is determined in part by the biological pathways that establish left/right (LR) body asymmetry during development. Cilia play a key role in this process, and candidate genes for dyslexia have also been recently shown to be involved in cilia formation. Defective cilia result not only in LR body asymmetry phenotypes but also brain midline phenotypes such as an absent corpus callosum. These findings suggest that the mechanisms for establishing LR asymmetry in the body are reused for brain midline development, which in turn influences traits such as handedness and reading ability. © 2013 The Authors.;,citation_author=William M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Overlapping genetic effects between suicidal ideation and neurocognitive functioning;,citation_abstract=Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. Several studies have indicated significant genetic influences on suicide-related phenotypes and mounting evidence from neurobiological research has linked deficits in neurocognitive abilities to suicide phenotypes. The goal of the present study was to estimate the heritability of suicidal ideation (SI) in a large sample of adolescents and determine if SI is genetically correlated with neurocognitive functioning. Methods: Genome-wide data (N = 3564 unrelated individuals of European Ancestry) were drawn from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort. Adolescents completed a psychiatric assessment, as well as a computerized neurocognitive battery to assess performance across four domains: memory, executive function, social cognition, and complex cognition. Genomic-relatedness-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) estimation was used to determine SNP-heritability (h 2SNP ) of SI and the genetic correlation (r G ) between SI and neurocognitive domains. Results: Nearly 17% of adolescents reported SI. The SNP-heritability estimate for SI was marginally significant (h 2SNP = 11%, SE = 8%, p = 0.086). Bivariate analyses indicated a significant r G between SI and emotion identification (r G = 0.79, SE = 0.45, p = 0.006; phenotypic correlation r = 0.04, p = 0.017). Limitations: It is possible that SI may represent a related, but differentially heritable construct from suicide attempts/completion and other comorbid psychopathology. Additionally, though genetic correlations point to shared genetic factors across traits, direct causal mechanisms cannot be deduced. Conclusions: Common heritable factors contribute to variation in SI and neurocognitive functioning. Genetic factors influencing emotion identification have significant genetic overlap with SI.;,citation_author=Leslie A. Brick;,citation_author=Marisa E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Executive function predictors of delayed memory deficits after mild traumatic brain injury;,citation_abstract=Delayed memory deficits are common for patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), according to a recent systematic review of meta-analyses (Karr et al., 2014). However, there has been little work to identify different cognitive processes that may be underpinning these delayed memory deficits for mTBI. Frontal cortex is important for delayed memory, and is implicated in the pathophysiology of mTBI; moreover, frontal lobes are typically considered the locus of executive abilities. To further explore these relationships, we sought to partly explain delayed memory deficits after mTBI by examining behavioral indicators of executive function. Results showed that sub-acute as well as chronic mTBI patients performed worse than controls on the delayed memory trial of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (Brandt &amp;amp;amp; Benedict, 2001), recalling approximately 18% and 15% fewer words, respectively. Furthermore, worse delayed memory performance was associated with less use of the cognitive strategy of semantic clustering, and with lower scores for the executive function composite from a standardized neuropsychological battery (NIH EXAMINER; Kramer et al., 2014). In contrast, serial clustering, a memory organizational strategy thought to be less dependent on executive function, did not show strong relationships to clinical status or delayed memory performance. This exploratory work suggests novel hypotheses to be tested in future, confirmatory studies, including that general executive functions and/or semantic clustering will mediate delayed memory deficits following mTBI.;,citation_author=James M.

We show that such models explain many hallmarks of human learning and highlight research on their underlying neural mechanisms. Systematic deviations from normative learning, which have been explored through computational psychiatry, provide a useful lens through which to understand psychiatric illness. In particular, normative models provide important insights into why different clinical and age groups show maladaptive learning behavior, thereby attempting to pinpoint the computational cause of dysfunctional decision making.

Visual-spatial short-term memory span was found to be a predictor specifically of math ability. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that visual short-term and working memory were found to specifically predict math achievement at each time point, while executive function skills predicted learning in general rather than learning in one specific domain.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is working memory capacity a causal factor in fluid intelligence?;,citation_abstract=It is well established that measures of reasoning ability and of working memory capacity (WMC) correlate positively. However, the question of what explains this relationship remains open. The purpose of this study was to investigate the capacity hypothesis, which ascribes causality to WMC. This hypothesis holds that people high in WMC are more successful in capacity-demanding cognitive tasks than people lower in WMC because they can temporarily maintain more information in the form of sub-goals, hypotheses, and partial solutions. Accordingly, this hypothesis predicts that the correlation between WMC and reasoning performance should increase as the capacity demands of the reasoning items increase. We tested this prediction using items from Raven’s Progressive Matrices and two measures of WMC, complex span and the k estimate from the Visual Arrays task. Neither WMC measure showed the effect predicted by the capacity hypothesis. Furthermore, the results cannot be attributed to restriction of range in performance on the individual reasoning items. This finding adds to existing evidence calling into question the capacity hypothesis, and, more generally, the view that WMC has a causal influence on fluid intelligence.;,citation_author=Alexander P.

The proliferation of mobile devices with touch screens makes them a natural next technological approach to assess information processing. The aims of this study were to determine the validity and reliability of using of a mobile device (Apple iPad or iTouch) to accurately measure RT. Sixty healthy young adults completed SRT and CRT tasks using a traditional test platform and mobile platforms on two occasions. The SRT was similar across test modality: 300, 287, and 280 milliseconds (ms) for the traditional, iPad, and iTouch, respectively. The CRT was similar within mobile devices, though slightly faster on the traditional: 359, 408, and 384 ms for traditional, iPad, and iTouch, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 for SRT and from 0.75 to 0.83 for CRT.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Debate: Oppositional defiant disorder is a real disorder;,citation_abstract=Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a valid mental health disorder, characterized by negativistic defiant behavior and angry, irritable mood. The very low and stable prevalence rate over development from early childhood into adulthood suggests that ODD does not erroneously medicalize normative childhood behavior. ODD is associated with significant impairments across multiple contexts and raises risks for other future psychopathology. Although simplistic tropes often suggest that ODD is merely the product of bad parenting, substantial evidence shows that it is instead influenced by a variety of factors, including genetic and neurobiological factors. Individuals with ODD evoke negative interactions with peers, teachers, coworkers, romantic partners, and parents. ODD is often misunderstood as being a mild form of conduct disorder (CD). Rather, in stark contrast to ODD, CD reflects a pattern of aggressive behaviors, violations of laws or status offenses, and psychopathic features. Mounting evidence for their distinction led to diagnostic changes distinguishing ODD and CD nearly a decade ago. Empirically supported treatments are available and help caregivers to develop specific parenting practices to meet the needs of children with ODD. Minimizing and mischaracterizing ODD increases the likelihood that families who are suffering may not seek the treatment that they need.;,citation_author=Jeffrey D. Burke;,citation_author=Spencer C.

Method: Selected summaries of the literature over the past decade are presented. Results: Research on ODD and CD during the past decade has addressed the complexity involved in identifying the primary risk factors and developmental pathways to disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). In some domains, research is entering an entirely new phase because of the availability of new technologies. In others, larger data sets and more complicated methodological and statistical techniques are testing increasingly complex models. Yet questions remain regarding the most useful subtyping systems, the identification of the most significant risk factors, and the relationships between risk factors from multiple domains. Conclusions: Convincing evidence of causal linkages remains elusive. Research has questioned the notion that CD is intractable, especially when multiple domains of risk and impairment are the targets of intervention. It is apparent that there is not one single causative factor; thus it is not likely that one single modality will suffice to treat CD.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants belonged to the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study, including 5249 individuals born in Pelotas, Brazil, in 1993. They were followed up to 18 to 19 years of age, with 81.3% retention. The data analysis was performed between August 8, 2015, and February 5, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ADHD status was first ascertained at 11 years of age using a screening instrument (hyperactivity subscale of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) calibrated for a DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis based on clinical interviews with parents using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. At 18 to 19 years of age, ADHD diagnosis was derived using DSM-5 criteria, except age at onset. We estimated the overlap between these groups assessed at 11 and 18 to 19 years of age and the rates of markers of impairment in these 2 groups compared with those without ADHD. RESULTS At 11 years of age, childhood ADHD (C-ADHD) was present in 393 individuals (8.9%). At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals (12.2%) fulfilled all DSM-5 criteria for young adult ADHD (YA-ADHD), except age at onset. After comorbidities were excluded, the prevalence of YA-ADHD without comorbidities decreased to 256 individuals (6.3%). Children with C-ADHD had a male preponderance not observed among children without ADHD (251 [63.9%] vs 1930 [47.9%] male, P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001), whereas the YA-ADHD group had a female preponderance (192 [39.0%] vs 1786 [50.4%] male, P $&amp;lt;$ .001). Both groups had increased levels of impairment in adulthood, as measured by traffic incidents, criminal behavior, incarceration, suicide attempts, and comorbidities. However, only 60 children (17.2%) with ADHD continued to have ADHD as young adults, and only 60 young adults (12.6%) with ADHD had the disorder in childhood. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study do not support the assumption that adulthood ADHD is necessarily a continuation of childhood ADHD. Rather, they suggest the existence of 2 syndromes that have distinct developmental trajectories.;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Second-generation PLINK: Rising to the challenge of larger and richer datasets;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1’s primary data format. FINDINGS To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, [Formula: see text]-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher’s exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Familial aggregation of clinical and neurocognitive features in sibling pairs with and without schizophrenia;,citation_abstract=Objective: Neurocognitive impairment was found to be heritable in individuals with schizophrenia and their relatives. However, the heritability of neurocognitive measures in families with and without schizophrenia has not been directly compared. In this study , we examined the genetic structure of clinical and neurocognitive measures in sibling pairs with and without schizophrenia to test the hypothesis that the familial aggregation of such measures may be altered by having schizophrenia. Method: A total of 278 subjects including patients with schizophrenia and their non-psychotic full siblings, healthy controls, and their full siblings were recruited. Heritability was estimated for working memory, episodic memory, executive function and attention, as well as clinical features, such as positive, negative and disorganization symptoms. Results: Many clinical and cognitive domains were impaired in subjects with schizophrenia and their non psychotic siblings. Negative symptoms, working memory, episodic memory and executive function, but not positive, disorganization symptoms and attention, were found to be significantly heritable in all sibling pairs. However, the heritability of working memory function was significantly (χ2(d.f. = 6) = 13.9, p = .031) decreased in proband sibling pairs (h2 = .38) as compared to control sibling pairs (h2 = .95). Significant genetic correlations were observed between negative symptoms and the cluster of working memory, episodic memory and executive function. Conclusions: Several neurocognitive measures were heritable in sibling pairs with and without schizophrenia. However, schizophrenia reduced the heritability of working memory, perhaps due to disease-related environmental or genetic factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Schizophrenia polygenic risk score predicts mnemonic hippocampal activity;,citation_abstract=The use of polygenic risk scores has become a practical translational approach to investigating the complex genetic architecture of schizophrenia, but the link between polygenic risk scores and pathophysiological components of this disorder has been the subject of limited research. We investigated in healthy volunteers whether schizophrenia polygenic risk score predicts hippocampal activity during simple memory encoding, which has been proposed as a risk-associated intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia. We analysed the relationship between polygenic risk scores and hippocampal activity in a discovery sample of 191 unrelated healthy volunteers from the USA and in two independent replication samples of 76 and 137 healthy unrelated participants from Europe and the USA, respectively. Polygenic risk scores for each individual were calculated as the sum of the imputation probability of reference alleles weighted by the natural log of odds ratio from the recent schizophrenia genome-wide association study. We examined hippocampal activity during simple memory encoding of novel visual stimuli assessed using blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI. Polygenic risk scores were significantly associated with hippocampal activity in the discovery sample [P = 0.016, family-wise error (FWE) corrected within Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) bilateral hippocampal-parahippocampal mask] and in both replication samples (P = 0.033, FWE corrected within AAL right posterior hippocampal-parahippocampal mask in Bari sample, and P = 0.002 uncorrected in the Duke Neurogenetics Study sample). The relationship between polygenic risk scores and hippocampal activity was consistently negative, i.e. lower hippocampal activity in individuals with higher polygenic risk scores, consistent with previous studies reporting decreased hippocampal-parahippocampal activity during declarative memory tasks in patients with schizophrenia and in their healthy siblings. Polygenic risk scores accounted for more than 8% of variance in hippocampal activity during memory encoding in discovery sample. We conclude that polygenic risk scores derived from the most recent schizophrenia genome-wide association study predict significant variability in hippocampal activity during memory encoding in healthy participants. Our findings validate mnemonic hippocampal activity as a genetic risk associated intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia, indicating that the aggregate neurobiological effect of schizophrenia risk alleles converges on this pattern of neural activity.;,citation_author=Qiang Chen;,citation_author=Gianluca Ursini;,citation_author=Adrienne L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fine Mapping Causal Variants with an Approximate Bayesian Method Using Marginal Test Statistics;,citation_abstract=© 2015 by the Genetics Society of America. Two recently developed fine-mapping methods, CAVIAR and PAINTOR, demonstrate better performance over other fine-mapping methods. They also have the advantage of using only the marginal test statistics and the correlation among SNPs. Both methods leverage the fact that the marginal test statistics asymptotically follow a multivariate normal distribution and are likelihood based. However, their relationship with Bayesian fine mapping, such as BIMBAM, is not clear. In this study, we first show that CAVIAR and BIMBAM are actually approximately equivalent to each other. This leads to a fine-mapping method using marginal test statistics in the Bayesian framework, which we call CAVIAR Bayes factor (CAVIARBF). Another advantage of the Bayesian framework is that it can answer both association and fine-mapping questions. We also used simulations to compare CAVIARBF with other methods under different numbers of causal variants. The results showed that both CAVIARBF and BIMBAM have better performance than PAINTOR and other methods. Compared to BIMBAM, CAVIARBF has the advantage of using only marginal test statistics and takes about one-quarter to one-fifth of the running time. We applied different methods on two independent cohorts of the same phenotype. Results showed that CAVIARBF, BIMBAM, and PAINTOR selected the same top 3 SNPs; however, CAVIARBF and BIMBAM had better consistency in selecting the top 10 ranked SNPs between the two cohorts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=MR-LDP: A two-sample Mendelian randomization for GWAS summary statistics accounting for linkage disequilibrium and horizontal pleiotropy;,citation_abstract=The proliferation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has prompted the use of two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV) for drawing reliable causal relationships between health risk factors and disease outcomes. However, the unique features of GWAS demand that MR methods account for both linkage disequilibrium (LD) and ubiquitously existing horizontal pleiotropy among complex traits, which is the phenomenon wherein a variant affects the outcome through mechanisms other than exclusively through the exposure. Therefore, statistical methods that fail to consider LD and horizontal pleiotropy can lead to biased estimates and false-positive causal relationships. To overcome these limitations, we propose a probabilistic model for MR analysis to identify the casual effects between risk factors and disease outcomes using GWAS summary statistics in the presence of LD and to properly account for horizontal pleiotropy among genetic variants (MR-LDP). MR-LDP utilizes a computationally efficient parameter-expanded variational Bayes expectation-maximization (PX-VBEM) algorithm to estimate the parameter of interest and further calibrates the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a likelihood ratio test. We then conducted comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of MR-LDP over the existing methods in terms of both type-I error control and point estimates. Moreover, we used two real exposure-outcome pairs (CAD-CAD and Height-Height; CAD for coronary artery disease) to validate the results from MR-LDP compared with alternative methods, showing that our method is more efficient in using all instrumental variants in LD. By further applying MR-LDP to lipid traits and body mass index (BMI) as risk factors for complex diseases, we identified multiple pairs of significant causal relationships, including a protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a positive causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on hemorrhoids.;,citation_author=Qing Cheng;,citation_author=Yi Yang;,citation_author=Xingjie Shi;,citation_author=Kar-Fu Yeung;,citation_author=Can Yang;,citation_author=Heng Peng;,citation_author=Jin Liu;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/08/03/684746.abstract;,citation_doi=10.1101/684746;,citation_journal_title=bioRxiv;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intolerance of uncertainty and startle potentiation in relation to different threat reinforcement rates;,citation_abstract=Fear conditioning research on threat predictability has primarily examined the impact of temporal (i.e., timing) predictability on the startle reflex. However, there are other key features of threat that can vary in predictability. For example, the reinforcement rate (i.e., frequency) of threat is a crucial factor underlying fear learning. The present study examined the impact of threat reinforcement rate on the startle reflex and self-reported anxiety during a fear conditioning paradigm. Forty-five participants completed a fear learning task in which the conditioned stimulus was reinforced with an electric shock to the forearm on 50% of trials in one block and 75% of trials in a second block, in counter-balanced order. The present study also examined whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU), the tendency to perceive or experience uncertainty as stressful or unpleasant, was associated with the startle reflex during conditions of low (50%) vs. high (75%) reinforcement. Results indicated that, across all participants, startle was greater during the 75% relative to the 50% reinforcement condition. IU was positively correlated with startle potentiation (i.e., increased startle response to the CS+ relative to the CS−) during the 50%, but not the 75%, reinforcement condition. Thus, despite receiving fewer electric shocks during the 50% reinforcement condition, individuals with high IU uniquely demonstrated greater defense system activation when impending threat was more uncertain. The association between IU and startle was independent of state anxiety. The present study adds to a growing literature on threat predictability and aversive responding, and suggests IU is associated with abnormal responding in the context of uncertain threat.;,citation_author=Brian Chin;,citation_author=Brady D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=GWAS-based pathway analysis differentiates between fluid and crystallized intelligence.;,citation_abstract=Cognitive abilities vary among people. About 40-50% of this variability is due to general intelligence (g), which reflects the positive correlation among individuals’ scores on diverse cognitive ability tests. g is positively correlated with many life outcomes, such as education, occupational status and health, motivating the investigation of its underlying biology. In psychometric research, a distinction is made between general fluid intelligence (gF) - the ability to reason in novel situations - and general crystallized intelligence (gC) - the ability to apply acquired knowledge. This distinction is supported by developmental and cognitive neuroscience studies. Classical epidemiological studies and recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have established that these cognitive traits have a large genetic component. However, no robust genetic associations have been published thus far due largely to the known polygenic nature of these traits and insufficient sample sizes. Here, using two GWAS datasets, in which the polygenicity of gF and gC traits was previously confirmed, a gene- and pathway-based approach was undertaken with the aim of characterizing and differentiating their genetic architecture. Pathway analysis, using genes selected on the basis of relaxed criteria, revealed notable differences between these two traits. gF appeared to be characterized by genes affecting the quantity and quality of neurons and therefore neuronal efficiency, whereas long-term depression (LTD) seemed to underlie gC. Thus, this study supports the gF-gC distinction at the genetic level and identifies functional annotations and pathways worthy of further investigation.;,citation_author=A Christoforou;,citation_author=T Espeseth;,citation_author=G Davies;,citation_author=C P D Fernandes;,citation_author=S Giddaluru;,citation_author=M Mattheisen;,citation_author=A Tenesa;,citation_author=S E Harris;,citation_author=D C Liewald;,citation_author=A Payton;,citation_author=W Ollier;,citation_author=M Horan;,citation_author=N Pendleton;,citation_author=P Haggarty;,citation_author=S Djurovic;,citation_author=S Herms;,citation_author=P Hoffman;,citation_author=S Cichon;,citation_author=J M Starr;,citation_author=A Lundervold;,citation_author=I Reinvang;,citation_author=V M Steen;,citation_author=I J Deary;,citation_author=S Le Hellard;,citation_publication_date=2014-09;,citation_cover_date=2014-09;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975275;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1111/gbb.12152;,citation_issn=1601-183X;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Genes.

We sought to examine patterns of recognition memory deficits in individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Memory performance and global cognition data were collected from participants with AD (n = 37), MCI (n = 37), and cognitively intact older adults (normal controls, NC; n = 35).

METHOD The Wechsler Digit Span Task was used to investigate verbal working memory in 52 schizophrenia patients, 56 of their first-degree relatives, and 73 nonpsychiatric comparison subjects. RESULTS The nonpsychotic relatives showed no impairment on the forward digit span task, a measure of general attention, but did show impairment on the backward digit span task, a measure of verbal working memory. Schizophrenia patients showed impairment on both the forward and backward digit span tasks.

In so doing, we address the reliability and validity of the tasks, and we consider more technical aspects of the tasks, such as optimal administration and scoring procedures. Finally, we discuss statistical and methodological techniques that have commonly been used in conjunction with WM span tasks, such as latent variable analysis and extreme-groups designs.;,citation_author=Andrew R A Conway;,citation_author=Michael J Kane;,citation_author=Michael F Bunting;,citation_author=Zach D Hambrick;,citation_author=Oliver Wilhelm;,citation_author=Randall W Engle;,citation_publication_date=2005-11;,citation_cover_date=2005-11;,citation_year=2005;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v020n021.p1399;,citation_issue=5;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Psychon.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Head Motion and Inattention/Hyperactivity Share Common Genetic Influences: Implications for fMRI Studies of ADHD ;,citation_abstract=© 2016 Couvy-Duchesne et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Head motion (HM) is a well known confound in analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data. Neuroimaging researchers therefore typically treat HM as a nuisance covariate in their analyses. Even so, it is possible that HM shares a common genetic influence with the trait of interest. Here we investigate the extent to which this relationship is due to shared genetic factors, using HM extracted from resting-state fMRI and maternal and self report measures of Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity from the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) scales. Our sample consisted of healthy young adult twins (N = 627 (63% females) including 95 MZ and 144 DZ twin pairs, mean age 22, who had mother-reported SWAN; N = 725 (58% females) including 101 MZ and 156 DZ pairs, mean age 25, with self reported SWAN). This design enabled us to distinguish genetic from environmental factors in the association between head movement and ADHD scales. HM was moderately correlated with maternal reports of Inattention (r = 0.17, p-value = 7.4E-5) and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity (r = 0.16, p-value = 2.9E-4), and these associations were mainly due to pleiotropic genetic factors with genetic correlations [95% CIs] of rg= 0.24 [0.02, 0.43] and rg= 0.23 [0.07, 0.39]. Correlations between self-reports and HM were not significant, due largely to increased measurement error. These results indicate that treating HM as a nuisance covariate in neuroimaging studies of ADHD will likely reduce power to detect between-group effects, as the implicit assumption of independence between HM and Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity is not warranted. The implications of this finding are problematic for fMRI studies of ADHD, as failing to apply HM correction is known to increase the likelihood of false positives. We discuss two ways to circumvent this problem: censoring the motion contaminated frames of the RS-fMRI scan or explicitly modeling the relationship between HM and Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity.;,citation_author=Baptiste Couvy-Duchesne;,citation_author=Jane L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The many faces of working memory and short-term storage;,citation_abstract=The topic of working memory (WM) is ubiquitous in research on cognitive psychology and on individual differ- ences. According to one definition, it is a small amount of information kept in a temporary state of heightened accessi- bility; it is used in most types of communication and problem solving. Short-term storage has been defined as the passive (i.e., non-attention-based, nonstrategic) component ofWMor, alternatively, as a passive store separate from an attention- basedWM. Here I note that much confusion has been created by the use by various investigators of many, subtly different definitions ofWMand short-termstorage. The definitions are sometimes made explicit and sometimes implied. As I ex- plain, the different definitions may have stemmed from the use of a wide variety of techniques to exploreWM, along with differences in theoretical orientation. By delineating nine previously used definitions ofWMand explaining how addi- tional ones may emerge from combinations of these nine, I hope to improve scientific discourse on WM. The potential advantages of clarity about definitions ofWMand short-term storage are illustrated with respect to several ongoing research controversies.;,citation_author=Nelson Cowan;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.3758/s13423-016-1191-6;,citation_issn=15315320;,citation_volume=24;,citation_journal_title=Psychon.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working-Memory Capacity Limits in a Theoretical Context.;,citation_abstract=After a brief definition and description of working memory (WM), several theoretical views are discussed. The view most emphasized is based on the idea that attention is critically important for WM. However, there are several ways in which attention can be used. The present suggestion is that all of the functions of attention are relevant to WM. A number of specific experimental tasks developed from different theoretical points of view are examined. This is done to make the case that the types of tasks that have been used most often to look at individual differences in WM are not as special as has typically been assumed. These tasks correlate well with scholastic abilities but so do other tasks that are suggested as possible alternatives. Correlations from various data sets between different WM measures and various measures of scholastic ability exemplify this point. Finally, conclusions are reached about the value of various measures of WM.

In this article, I assess many possible reasons that working memory performance improves with development. A first glance at the literature leads to the weird impression that working memory capacity reaches adult levels during infancy but then regresses during childhood. In place of that unlikely explanation, I consider how infant studies may lead to overestimates of capacity if one neglects supports that the tasks provide, compared with adult-level tasks. Further development of working memory during the school years is also considered. Many investigators have come to suspect that working memory capacity may be constant after infancy because of various factors such as developmental increases in knowledge, filtering out of irrelevant distractions, encoding and rehearsal strategies, and pattern formation. With each of these factors controlled, though, working memory still improves during the school years. Suggestions are made for research to bridge the gap between infant and child developmental research, to understand the focus and control of attention in working memory and how these skills develop, and to pinpoint the nature of capacity and its development from infancy forward.;,citation_author=Nelson Cowan;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1745691615621279;,citation_issn=17456924;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Perspect.

Here, we used event-related functional MRI to test the hypothesis that developmental improvements in manipulation, relative to pure maintenance, are associated with increased recruitment of dorsolateral (DL) prefrontal cortex (PFC) and superior parietal cortex. Three age groups (8-12 years old, 13-17 years old, and 18-25 years old) performed an object-working memory task with separate maintenance and manipulation conditions. We found that 8- to 12-year-olds did not perform the task as well as adolescents or adults, particularly on trials requiring manipulation in addition to maintenance. In this study, no age differences were observed in the activation profile of ventrolateral PFC, a region associated with online maintenance. In contrast, unlike the older participants, 8- to 12-year-olds failed to recruit right DL PFC and bilateral superior parietal cortex during the delay period for manipulation relative to maintenance. This group difference was observed specifically during the delay period, while participants reordered items in working memory, and could not be accounted for by group differences in performance. Across participants, activation levels in right DL PFC and superior parietal cortex, but not ventrolateral PFC, were positively correlated with performance on manipulation trials.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Thalamic control of layer 1 circuits in prefrontal cortex;,citation_abstract=Knowledge of thalamocortical (TC) processing comes mainly from studying core thalamic systems that project to middle layers of primary sensory cortices. However, most thalamic relay neurons comprise a matrix of cells that are densest in the &amp;amp;amp;quot;nonspecific&amp;quot; thalamic nuclei and usually target layer 1 (L1) of multiple cortical areas. A longstanding hypothesis is that matrix TC systems are crucial for regulating neocortical excitability during changing behavioral states, yet we know almost nothing about the mechanisms of such regulation. It is also unclear whether synaptic and circuit mechanisms that are well established for core sensory TC systems apply to matrix TC systems. Here we describe studies of thalamic matrix influences on mouse prefrontal cortex using optogenetic and in vitro electrophysiology techniques. Channelrhodopsin-2 was expressed in midline and paralaminar (matrix) thalamic neurons, and their L1-projectingTC axons were activated optically. Contrary to conventional views,wefound that atrixTCprojections to L1 could transmit relatively strong, fast, high-fidelity synaptic signals. L1 TC projections preferentially drove inhibitory interneurons of L1, especially those of the latespiking subtype, and often triggered feedforward inhibition in both L1 interneurons and pyramidal ce lls of L2/L3. Responses during repetitive stimulation were far more sustained for matrix than for core sensory TC pathways. Thus, matrix TC circuits appear to be specialized for robust transmission over relatively extended periods, consistent with the sort of persistent activation observed during working memory and potentially applicable to state-dependent regulation of excitability. © 2012 the authors.;,citation_author=Scott J Cruikshank;,citation_author=Omar J Ahmed;,citation_author=Tanya R Stevens;,citation_author=Saundra L Patrick;,citation_author=Amalia N Gonzalez;,citation_author=Margot Elmaleh;,citation_author=Barry W Connors;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=49;,citation_doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3231-12.2012;,citation_issn=02706474;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=J.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study used data from 2 tertiary epilepsy centers: Montreal Neurological Institute in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital in Grenoble, France. Participants included consecutive patients (n = 103) with focal drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017. Participant selection criteria were cortical stimulation during implantation, subsequent open surgical procedure with a follow-up of 1 or more years, and complete neuroimaging data sets for superimposition between intracranial electrodes and the resection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cortical stimulation–induced typical electroclinical seizures, the volume of the surgical resection, and the percentage of resected electrode contacts inducing a seizure or encompassing the cortical stimulation–informed and spontaneous seizure-onset zones were identified. These measures were correlated with good (Engel class I) and poor (Engel classes II-IV) surgical outcomes. Electroclinical characteristics associated with cortical stimulation–induced seizures were analyzed. RESULTS In total, 103 patients were included, of whom 54 (52.4%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 31 (11) years. Fifty-nine patients (57.3%) had cortical stimulation–induced seizures. The percentage of patients with cortical stimulation–induced electroclinical seizures was higher in the good outcome group than in the poor outcome group (31 of 44 [70.5%] vs 28 of 59 [47.5%]; P = .02). The percentage of the resected contacts encompassing the cortical stimulation–informed seizure-onset zone correlated with surgical outcome (median [range] percentage in good vs poor outcome: 63.2% [0%-100%] vs 33.3% [0%-84.6%]; Spearman ρ = 0.38; P = .003). A similar result was observed for spontaneous seizures (median [range] percentage in good vs poor outcome: 57.1% [0%-100%] vs 32.7% [0%-100%]; Spearman ρ = 0.32; P = .002).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relationship between direct cortical stimulation and induced high-frequency activity for language mapping during SEEG recording;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE The authors assessed the clinical relevance of preoperative task-induced high-frequency activity (HFA) for language mapping in patients with refractory epilepsy during stereoelectroencephalography recording. Although HFA evaluation was described as a putative biomarker of cognition, its clinical relevance for mapping language networks was assessed predominantly by studies using electrocorticography (ECOG). METHODS Forty-two patients with epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode implantation during both task-induced HFA and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) language mapping were evaluated. The spatial and functional relevance of each method in terms of specificity and sensitivity were evaluated. RESULTS The results showed that the two methods were able to map classic language regions, and a large and bilateral language network was obtained with induced HFA. At a regional level, differences were observed between methods for parietal and temporal lobes: HFA recruited a larger number of cortical parietal sites, while DCS involved more cortical temporal sites. Importantly, the results showed that HFA predicts language interference induced by DCS with high specificity (92.4%; negative predictive value 95.9%) and very low sensitivity (8.9%; positive predictive value 4.8%). CONCLUSIONS DCS language mapping appears to be more appropriate for an extensive temporal mapping than induced HFA mapping. Furthermore, induced HFA should be used as a complement to DCS to preselect the number of stimulated sites during DCS, by omitting those reported as HFA-. This may be a considerable advantage because it allows a reduction in the duration of the stimulation procedure. Several parameters to be used for each method are discussed and the results are interpreted in relation to previous results reported in ECOG studies. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.2.JNS192751;,citation_author=Pauline Cuisenier;,citation_author=Bénédicte Testud;,citation_author=Lorella Minotti;,citation_author=Samuel El Bouzaïdi Tiali;,citation_author=Laurence Martineau;,citation_author=Anne-Sophie Job;,citation_author=Agnès Trébuchon;,citation_author=Pierre Deman;,citation_author=Manik Bhattacharjee;,citation_author=Dominique Hoffmann;,citation_author=Jean-Philippe Lachaux;,citation_author=Monica Baciu;,citation_author=Philippe Kahane;,citation_author=Marcela Perrone-Bertolotti;,citation_publication_date=2021-04;,citation_cover_date=2021-04;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://thejns.org/view/journals/j-neurosurg/134/4/article-p1251.xml;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.3171/2020.2.JNS192751;,citation_issn=0022-3085, 1933-0693;,citation_volume=134;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Neurosurgery;">

Yet, the influence of atypical neuroleptics on attention is still controversial. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of atypical neuroleptics in tasks requiring alertness, selective attention or visual orienting. Thirteen stabilized schizophrenic patients receiving atypical neuroleptics were compared to 13 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and study level, in a choice reaction time (CRT) task and a visual-orienting task [cued target detection (CTD) task]. The results showed that patients and controls obtained comparable reaction times (RTs) in the CRT task. In the CTD task, both groups had comparable RTs but the presence of invalid cues caused a greater attentional cost in both visual fields for patients compared to controls, indicating a symmetrical disengagement deficit. To conclude, patients treated with atypical neuroleptics had a phasic alertness ability similar to controls. By contrast, an impairment of disengagement was present in those patients.

To identify brain regions involved in visual classification learning under noisy conditions, we developed a task on the basis of the classical dot pattern prototype distortion task [M. I. Posner, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 68, 113–118, 1964]. Twenty-seven healthy young adults were required to assign distorted patterns of dots into one of two categories, each defined by its prototype. Categorization uncertainty was modulated parametrically by means of Shannon’s entropy formula and set to the levels of 3, 7, and 8.5 bits/dot within subsets of the stimuli. Feedback was presented after each trial, and two parallel versions of the task were developed to contrast practiced and unpracticed performance within a single session. Using event-related fMRI, areas showing increasing activation with categorization uncertainty and decreasing activation with training were identified. Both networks largely overlapped and included areas involved in visuospatial processing (inferior temporal and posterior parietal areas), areas involved in cognitive processes requiring a high amount of cognitive control (posterior medial wall), and a cortico-striatal–thalamic loop through the body of the caudate nucleus. Activity in the medial prefrontal wall was increased when subjects received negative as compared with positive feedback, providing further evidence for its important role in mediating the error signal.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inhibition, Updating Working Memory, and Shifting Predict Reading Disability Symptoms in a Hybrid Model: Project KIDS.;,citation_abstract=Recent achievement research suggests that executive function (EF), a set of regulatory processes that control both thought and action necessary for goal-directed behavior, is related to typical and atypical reading performance. This project examines the relation of EF, as measured by its components, Inhibition, Updating Working Memory, and Shifting, with a hybrid model of reading disability (RD). Our sample included 420 children who participated in a broader intervention project when they were in KG-third grade (age M = 6.63 years, SD = 1.04 years, range = 4.79-10.40 years). At the time their EF was assessed, using a parent-report Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), they had a mean age of 13.21 years (SD = 1.54 years; range = 10.47-16.63 years). The hybrid model of RD was operationalized as a composite consisting of four symptoms, and set so that any child could have any one, any two, any three, any four, or none of the symptoms included in the hybrid model. The four symptoms include low word reading achievement, unexpected low word reading achievement, poorer reading comprehension compared to listening comprehension, and dual-discrepancy response-to-intervention, requiring both low achievement and low growth in word reading. The results of our multilevel ordinal logistic regression analyses showed a significant relation between all three components of EF (Inhibition , Updating Working Memory, and Shifting) and the hybrid model of RD , and that the strength of EF’s predictive power for RD classification was the highest when RD was modeled as having at least one or more symptoms. Importantly, the chances of being classified as having RD increased as EF performance worsened and decreased as EF performance improved. The question of whether any one EF component would emerge as a superior predictor was also examined and results showed that Inhibition, Updating Working Memory, and Shifting were equally valuable as predictors of the hybrid model of RD. In total, all EF components were significant and equally effective predictors of RD when RD was operationalized using the hybrid model.;,citation_author=Mia C.

People’s differences in cognitive functions are partly heritable and are associated with important life outcomes. Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies of cognitive functions have found evidence for polygenic effects yet, to date, there are few replicated genetic associations. Here we use data from the UK Biobank sample to investigate the genetic contributions to variation in tests of three cognitive functions and in educational attainment. GWA analyses were performed for verbal-numerical reasoning (N=36 035), memory (N=112 067), reaction time (N=111 483) and for the attainment of a college or a university degree (N=111 114). We report genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based associations in 20 genomic regions, and significant gene-based findings in 46 regions. These include findings in the ATXN2, CYP2DG, APBA1 and CADM2 genes. We report replication of these hits in published GWA studies of cognitive function, educational attainment and childhood intelligence. There is also replication, in UK Biobank, of SNP hits reported previously in GWA studies of educational attainment and cognitive function. GCTA-GREML analyses, using common SNPs (minor allele frequency \textgreater 0.01), indicated significant SNP-based heritabilities of 31% (s.e.m.=1.8%) for verbal-numerical reasoning, 5% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for memory, 11% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for reaction time and 21% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for educational attainment. Polygenic score analyses indicate that up to 5% of the variance in cognitive test scores can be predicted in an independent cohort. The genomic regions identified include several novel loci, some of which have been associated with intracranial volume, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.;,citation_author=G.

Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity.

A population-based cohort study;,citation_abstract=The association between reaction times and psychometric intelligence test scores is a major plank of the information-processing approach to mental ability differences. An important but unavailable datum is the effect size of the correlation in the normal population. Here we describe the associations between scores on a test of general mental ability (Alice Heim 4, AH4) and reaction times using a ’Hick’-style device. The sample is 900 people aged 56 years who are broadly representative of the Scottish population. AH4 Part I total scores correlated -.31 with simple reaction time, -.49 with four-choice reaction time, and -.26 with intraindividual variability in both reaction time procedures. The correlation between AH4 scores and the difference between simple and four-choice reaction time was -.15. Separate analyses were conducted after partitioning the total group according to sex, educational level, social class grouping, and number of errors on the four-choice reaction time task. None of these factors significantly altered the effect sizes. This is the first report of reaction time and psychometric intelligence in a large, normal sample of the population. It provides a benchmark for other studies and suggests larger effect sizes than the majority of present studies, which are dominated by young student samples. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reaction time explains IQ’s association with death;,citation_abstract=Lower IQ is associated with earlier death, but the cause of the relationship is unknown. In the present study, psychometric intelligence and reaction times were both significantly related to all-cause mortality in a representative sample of 898 people aged 56 years who were followed up with respect to survival until age 70. The association between IQ and mortality remained significant after adjusting for education, occupational social class, and smoking, all of which have been hypothesized as confounding variables. The effect of IQ on mortality was not significant after adjusting for reaction time, suggesting that reduced efficiency of information processing might link lower mental ability and earlier death. This new field of cognitive epidemiology provides arguably the strongest evidence for the importance, of psychological factors in physical health and human survival. Finding the mechanisms that relate psychometric intelligence to mortality might help in formulating effective interventions to reduce inequalities in health.;,citation_author=Ian J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Are processing speed tasks biomarkers of cognitive aging?;,citation_abstract=We examined the association between 5 processing speed measures and general cognitive ability in a large (¿900) sample of relatively healthy men and women at age 70. The processing speed tests were the Wechsler Digit Symbol-Coding and Symbol Search, simple reaction time, 4-choice reaction time, and inspection time. To inquire whether the processing speed tasks might be biomarkers of cognitive aging, we examined the attenuations in their associations with general cognitive ability after adjusting for cognitive ability measured almost 60 years earlier. With the exception of inspection time, the attenuations were substantial. Inspection time was the only processing speed measure-all of which were measured at age 70-whose correlation with cognitive ability at age 70 was significantly greater than the correlation with cognitive ability at age 11. In old age, individual differences in most commonly used measures of processing speed are largely dependent on childhood cognitive ability. For all processing speed tasks, a little variance is left that appears to be related to aging differences. Inspection time, the marker that was least dependent on childhood intelligence, should be considered further as one biomarker of cognitive aging. © 2010 American Psychological Association.;,citation_author=Ian J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychopathy;,citation_abstract=Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by a constellation of affective, interpersonal, lifestyle and antisocial features whose antecedents can be identified in a subgroup of young people showing severe antisocial behaviour. The prevalence of psychopathy in the general population is thought to be ~1%, but is up to 25% in prisoners. The aetiology of psychopathy is complex, with contributions of both genetic and environmental risk factors, and gene–environment interactions and correlations. Psychopathy is characterized by structural and functional brain abnormalities in cortical (such as the prefrontal and insular cortices) and subcortical (for example, the amygdala and striatum) regions leading to neurocognitive disruption in emotional responsiveness, reinforcement-based decision-making and attention. Although no effective treatment exists for adults with psychopathy, preliminary intervention studies targeting key neurocognitive disturbances have shown promising results. Given that psychopathy is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders and increases the risk of physical health problems, educational and employment failure, accidents and criminality, the identification of children and young people at risk for this personality disorder and preventative work are important.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigating the representation of uncertainty in neuronal circuits;,citation_abstract=Skilled behavior often displays signatures of Bayesian inference. In order for the brain to implement the required computations, neuronal activity must carry accurate information about the uncertainty of sensory inputs. Two major approaches have been proposed to study neuronal representations of uncertainty. The first one, the Bayesian decoding approach, aims primarily at decoding the posterior probability distribution of the stimulus from population activity using Bayes’ rule, and indirectly yields uncertainty estimates as a by-product. The second one, which we call the correlational approach, searches for specific features of neuronal activity (such as tuning-curve width and maximum firing-rate) which correlate with uncertainty. To compare these two approaches, we derived a new normative model of sound source localization by Interaural Time Difference (ITD), that reproduces a wealth of behavioral and neural observations. We found that several features of neuronal activity correlated with uncertainty on average, but none provided an accurate estimate of uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating that the correlational approach may not reliably identify which aspects of neuronal responses represent uncertainty. In contrast, the Bayesian decoding approach reveals that the activity pattern of the entire population was required to reconstruct the trial-to-trial posterior distribution with Bayes’ rule. These results suggest that uncertainty is unlikely to be represented in a single feature of neuronal activity , and highlight the importance of using a Bayesian decoding approach when exploring the neural basis of uncertainty.;,citation_author=Guillaume P.

We report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 20,183 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 35,191 controls that identifies variants surpassing genome-wide significance in 12 independent loci, finding important new information about the underlying biology of ADHD. Associations are enriched in evolutionarily constrained genomic regions and loss-of-function intolerant genes and around brain-expressed regulatory marks. Analyses of three replication studies: a cohort of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, a self-reported ADHD sample and a meta-analysis of quantitative measures of ADHD symptoms in the population, support these findings while highlighting study-specific differences on genetic overlap with educational attainment. Strong concordance with GWAS of quantitative population measures of ADHD symptoms supports that clinical diagnosis of ADHD is an extreme expression of continuous heritable

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transdiagnostic phenotypes of compulsive behavior and associations with psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological affective processing;,citation_abstract=Abstract Compulsivity is a poorly understood transdiagnostic construct thought to underlie multiple disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, addictions, and binge eating. Our current understanding of the causes of compulsive behavior remains primarily based on investigations into specific diagnostic categories or findings relying on one or two laboratory measures to explain complex phenotypic variance. This proof-of-concept study drew on a heterogeneous sample of community-based individuals ( N  = 45; 18–45 years; 25 female) exhibiting compulsive behavioral patterns in alcohol use, eating, cleaning, checking, or symmetry. Data-driven statistical modeling of multidimensional markers was utilized to identify homogeneous subtypes that were independent of traditional clinical phenomenology. Markers were based on well-defined measures of affective processing and included psychological assessment of compulsivity, behavioral avoidance, and stress, neurocognitive assessment of reward vs. punishment learning , and biological assessment of the cortisol awakening response. The neurobiological validity of the subtypes was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical modeling identified three stable, distinct subtypes of compulsivity and affective processing, which we labeled “Compulsive Non-Avoidant”, “Compulsive Reactive” and “Compulsive Stressed”. They differed meaningfully on validation measures of mood, intolerance of uncertainty, and urgency. Most importantly, subtypes captured neurobiological variance on amygdala-based resting-state functional connectivity, suggesting they were valid representations of underlying neurobiology and highlighting the relevance of emotion-related brain networks in compulsive behavior. Although independent larger samples are needed to confirm the stability of subtypes, these data offer an integrated understanding of how different systems may interact in compulsive behavior and provide new considerations for guiding tailored intervention decisions.;,citation_author=Lauren Den Ouden;,citation_author=Chao Suo;,citation_author=Lucy Albertella;,citation_author=Lisa-Marie Greenwood;,citation_author=Rico S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between intelligence and reaction time varies with age: Results from three representative narrow-age age cohorts at 30, 50 and 69 years;,citation_abstract=Background Reaction time (RT) has played a prominent part in research on mental ability for over a century. Throughout this time a number of questions have been repeatedly posed: what is the relationship of RT to general mental ability, and is this the same for simple and choice RT? Does the relationship change with age? How important is RT variability compared with mean values? Here we examine these questions in three population representative cohorts. Methods Participants were drawn from the West of Scotland Twenty-07 study, a longitudinal population based study designed to investigate socially structured health inequalities. At the fourth wave of data collection, part I of the Alice Heim 4 (AH4) test of general intelligence was administered, and reaction times were measured using a portable device. Means and standard deviations were recorded for simple and 4-choice reaction time. Full data were available for 2196 participants, comprising 714 aged 30 years, 813 aged 50, and 669 aged 69. Results Correlations of simple RT means with AH4 scores were − 0.27, − 0.30 and − 0.32, for age 30, 50 and 69, respectively; and − 0.44, − 0.47 and − 0.53 for 4-choice RT. The underlying relationships showed evidence of non-linearity, particularly for simple RT, with stronger association at lower AH4 scores. This was more pronounced with age. RT variability was correlated with the mean at 0.57, 0.57, 0.58 for simple RT; and 0.53, 0.53, 0.47 for choice RT. Residuals from regressing the RT variability on the mean showed no association with AH4 in the case of simple RT but a weak association for choice RT which decreased with age. Conclusions There is a strong correlation of RT means with general mental ability which increases with age. The underlying relationship is complex for SRT. RT variability shows little association with mental ability when its dependence on the mean is removed. Combining samples with disparate ages may overestimate the association.;,citation_author=Geoff Der;,citation_author=Ian J.

Evidence for this link is mixed, however, and recent studies suggest that different symptom dimensions in ODD may have different outcomes. The authors examined links between ODD, CD, and their young adult outcomes in the Great Smoky Mountains Study (E. J. Costello et al., 1996), a longitudinal data set with over 8,000 observations of 1,420 individuals (56% male) covering ages 9–21 years. ODD was a significant predictor of later CD in boys but not in girls after control for comorbid CD and subthreshold CD symptomatology. Transitions between ODD and CD were less common than anticipated, however, particularly during adolescence. The authors examined characteristics and outcomes of children with pure ODD, pure CD, and combined CD/ODD. Alongside many similarities in childhood and adolescent correlates, key differences were also identified: CD largely predicted behavioral outcomes, whereas ODD showed stronger prediction to emotional disorders in early adult life. Factor analysis identified irritable and headstrong dimensions in ODD symptoms that showed differential prediction to later behavioral and emotional disorders. Overall, the results underscore the utility of retaining separate ODD and CD diagnoses in $<$em$>$DSM–V$<$/em$>$.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive factor structure and invariance in people with schizophrenia, their unaffected siblings, and controls;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Separable, but positively correlated, factors emerge from analyses of cognitive test data in schizophrenia and control samples (eg, verbal memory and processing speed) and these factors guide data reduction. Additionally, data support a hierarchical model of cognitive performance, in which these correlations reflect the influence of a higher-order factor, referred to as &amp;amp;amp;quot;g.&amp;quot; We tested these findings in large, carefully screened samples of people with schizophrenia (n = 496), their unaffected siblings (n = 504), and controls (n = 823). Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive performance in schizophrenia is more generalized across domains than among siblings and controls. METHOD: A combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) and multiple groups CFA (MCFA) was used. RESULTS: EFA yielded factors for verbal memory, visual memory, processing speed, working memory span, nback performance, and card sorting. The solution was consistent across groups, in terms of the factor assignments of individual cognitive variables and the magnitude of loadings. Method variance may have contributed to the card sorting, visual memory, and nback factors. CFA indicated that the hierarchical model, incorporating a &quot;g&quot; factor, was a good fit for data from all groups. MCFA suggested that this hierarchical structure was fully invariant for controls and siblings. While the variable/factor loadings for the schizophrenia group also were invariant with comparison groups, factor/&quot;g&quot; loadings were higher in schizophrenia, as were correlations among factor-based composite scores. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive variables sort into domains consistently in schizophrenia, unaffected siblings, and controls. However, performance in schizophrenia is more generalized and less domain specific.;,citation_author=Dwight Dickinson;,citation_author=Terry E Goldberg;,citation_author=James M Gold;,citation_author=B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differential effects of common variants in SCN2A on general cognitive ability, brain physiology, and messenger RNA expression in schizophrenia cases and control individuals.;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE One approach to understanding the genetic complexity of schizophrenia is to study associated behavioral and biological phenotypes that may be more directly linked to genetic variation. OBJECTIVE To identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with general cognitive ability (g) in people with schizophrenia and control individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Genomewide association study, followed by analyses in unaffected siblings and independent schizophrenia samples, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of brain physiology in vivo, and RNA sequencing in postmortem brain samples. The discovery cohort and unaffected siblings were participants in the National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Brain Disorders Branch schizophrenia genetics studies. Additional schizophrenia cohorts were from psychiatric treatment settings in the United States, Japan, and Germany. The discovery cohort comprised 339 with schizophrenia and 363 community control participants. Follow-up analyses studied 147 unaffected siblings of the schizophrenia cases and independent schizophrenia samples including a total of an additional 668 participants. Imaging analyses included 87 schizophrenia cases and 397 control individuals. Brain tissue samples were available for 64 cases and 61 control individuals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We studied genomewide association with g, by group, in the discovery cohort. We used selected genotypes to test specific associations in unaffected siblings and independent schizophrenia samples. Imaging analyses focused on activation in the prefrontal cortex during working memory. Brain tissue studies yielded messenger RNA expression levels for RefSeq transcripts. RESULTS The schizophrenia discovery cohort showed genomewide-significant association of g with polymorphisms in sodium channel gene SCN2A, accounting for 10.4% of g variance (rs10174400, P = 9.27 × 10-10). Control individuals showed a trend for g/genotype association with reversed allelic directionality. The genotype-by-group interaction was also genomewide significant (P = 1.75 × 10-9). Siblings showed a genotype association with g parallel to the schizophrenia group and the same interaction pattern. Parallel, but weaker, associations with cognition were found in independent schizophrenia samples.

Sequencing of RNA in brain revealed reduced expression in 2 of 3 SCN2A alternative transcripts in the patient group, with genotype-by-group interaction, that again paralleled the cognition effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of donepezil on cognitive performance after sleep deprivation;,citation_abstract=Objectives To identify tasks that were sensitive to a temporary decline in cognitive performance after sleep deprivation and to investigate the ability of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil to reverse any sleep deprivation-induced impairment. Methods Thirty healthy volunteers were administered either a 5-mg daily dose of donepezil or placebo for 14-17days, in a double-blind parallel group design, then underwent either 24h sleep deprivation or a normal night of sleep in non-blinded crossover, and were subsequently tested on a battery of cognitive tasks designed to measure different components of memory and executive function. Results Sleep deprivation selectively impaired performance on several memory tasks whilst also impairing non-memory function on these tasks. Performance on other tasks was spared. Despite partially reversing the decline in subjective alertness associated with sleep deprivation, treatment with donepezil failed to significantly reverse the decline in cognitive performance on any of the tasks. Conclusions The results demonstrate the sensitivity of certain tests, particularly those that measure memory function, to cognitive impairment after sleep deprivation. The inability of donepezil to reverse this performance decline suggests that the sleep deprivation model of cognitive impairment may not be suitable for detecting pro-cognitive effects of cholinergic augmentation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotion regulation and substance use frequency in women with substance dependence and borderline personality disorder receiving dialectical behavior therapy;,citation_abstract=Background: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) identifies emotion dysregulation as central to the dangerous impulsivity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) including substance use disorders, and DBT targets improved emotion regulation as a primary mechanism of change. However, improved emotion regulation with DBT and associations between such improvement and behavioral outcomes such as substance use has not been previously reported. Objective: Thus, the goal of this study was to assess for improvement in emotion regulation and to examine the relationship between improvements in the emotion regulation and substance use problems following DBT treatment. Method: Emotion regulation as assessed by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, depressed mood as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, and their associations with substance use frequency were investigated in 27 women with substance dependence and BPD receiving 20 weeks of DBT in an academic community outpatient substance abuse treatment program. Results: Results indicated improved emotion regulation, improved mood, and decreased substance use frequency. Further, emotion regulation improvement, but not improved mood, explained the variance of decreased substance use frequency. Conclusion and Scientific Significance: This is the first study to demonstrate improved emotion regulation in BPD patients treated with DBT and to show that improved emotion regulation can account for increased behavioral control in BPD patients. Significance and future research: Emotion regulation assessment is recommended for future studies to further clarify the etiology and maintenance of disorders associated with emotional dysregulation such as BPD and substance dependence and to further explore emotion regulation as a potential mechanism of change for clinical interventions.;,citation_author=Seth R.

Accordingly, memory impairment is frequent in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the functional relevance of potentially epilepsy-induced reorganisation for memory formation is still not entirely clear. Therefore, we investigated whole-brain functional correlates of verbal and non-verbal memory encoding and subsequent memory formation in 56 (25 right sided) mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 21 controls. We applied an fMRI task of learning scenes, faces, and words followed by an out-of-scanner recognition test. During encoding of faces and scenes left and right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients had consistently reduced activation in the epileptogenic mesial temporal lobe compared with controls. Activation increases in patients were apparent in extra-temporal regions, partly asso­ ciated with subsequent memory formation (left frontal regions and basal ganglia), and patients had less deac­ tivation in regions often linked to the default mode and auditory networks. The more specific subsequent memory contrast indicated only marginal group differences. Correlating patients’ encoding activation with memory performance both within the paradigm and with independent clinical measures demonstrated pre­ dominantly increased contralateral mesio-temporal activation supporting intact memory performance. In left temporal lobe epilepsy patients, left frontal activation was also correlated with better verbal memory perfor­ mance. Taken together, our findings hint towards minor extra-temporal plasticity in mesial temporal lobe epi­ lepsy patients, which is in line with pre-surgical impairment and post-surgical memory decline in many patients. Further, data underscore the importance of particularly the contralateral mesial temporal lobe itself, to maintain intact memory performance.;,citation_author=Anna Doll;,citation_author=Martin Wegrzyn;,citation_author=Anissa Benzait;,citation_author=Markus Mertens;,citation_author=Friedrich G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preschool irritability predicts child psychopathology, functional impairment, and service use at age nine;,citation_abstract=Background Little is known about the predictive validity and clinical significance of chronic irritability during early childhood. This prospective, longitudinal study examined associations of preschool chronic irritability with psychiatric disorders, functional impairment, and service use at age nine in a large community sample. Methods Four hundred and forty-six children were assessed at age three and again at age nine. Child psychopathology and functional impairment were assessed at age three with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) with parents and at age nine with the Kiddie-Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) with parents and children. Items from the PAPA were used to create a dimensional measure of chronic irritability at age three. At age nine, mothers, fathers, and youth completed the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED). Results Chronic irritability at age three predicted any current and lifetime anxiety disorders at age nine, current and lifetime generalized anxiety disorder, and current separation anxiety, after controlling for baseline anxiety disorders. In addition, preschool irritability predicted increases in anxiety and disruptive behavior disorder symptoms on the K-SADS, and maternal and paternal reports of depressive and anxiety symptoms on the CDI and SCARED. Lastly, preschool irritability predicted greater functional impairment and outpatient treatment use, even after controlling for all psychiatric disorders at baseline.

Of the tasks nominated for goal maintenance, the most developed paradigms were operant delayed-non-matching-to-position tasks, and touch-screen variants of these may hold particular promise. For memory capacity, the task recommended for further development was the span task, although it is recognized that more work on its neural substrates is required. For interference control, versions of the n-back task were felt to resemble the deficits found in schizophrenia, although additional development of these tasks is also required. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Paul A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Meta-analytical transdiagnostic neural correlates in common pediatric psychiatric disorders;,citation_abstract=In the last decades, neuroimaging studies have attempted to unveil the neurobiological markers underlying pediatric psychiatric disorders. Yet, the vast majority of neuroimaging studies still focus on a single nosological category, which limit our understanding of the shared/specific neural correlates between these disorders. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the transdiagnostic neural correlates through a novel and data-driven meta-analytical method. A data-driven meta-analysis was carried out which grouped similar experiments’ topographic map together, irrespectively of nosological categories and task-characteristics. Then, activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was performed on each group of experiments to extract spatially convergent brain regions. One hundred forty-seven experiments were retrieved (3124 cases compared to 3100 controls): 79 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 32 conduct/oppositional defiant disorder, 14 anxiety disorders, 22 major depressive disorders. Four significant groups of experiments were observed. Functional characterization suggested that these groups of aberrant brain regions may be implicated internally/externally directed processes, attentional control of affect, somato-motor and visual processes. Furthermore, despite that some differences in rates of studies involving major depressive disorders were noticed, nosological categories were evenly distributed between these four sets of regions. Our results may reflect transdiagnostic neural correlates of pediatric psychiatric disorders, but also underscore the importance of studying pediatric psychiatric disorders simultaneously rather than independently to examine differences between disorders.;,citation_author=Jules R.

Results from a large, population-based sample;,citation_abstract=\textlessp\textgreaterAlthough maltreatment is a known risk factor for multiple adverse outcomes across the lifespan, its effects on cognitive development, especially memory, are poorly understood. Using data from a large, nationally representative sample of young adults (Add Health), we examined the effects of physical and sexual abuse on working and short-term memory in adulthood. We examined the association between exposure to maltreatment as well as its timing of first onset after adjusting for covariates. Of our sample, 16.50% of respondents were exposed to physical abuse and 4.36% to sexual abuse by age 17. An analysis comparing unexposed respondents to those exposed to physical or sexual abuse did not yield any significant differences in adult memory performance. However, two developmental time periods emerged as important for shaping memory following exposure to sexual abuse, but in opposite ways. Relative to non-exposed respondents, those exposed to sexual abuse during early childhood (ages 3–5), had better number recall and those first exposed during adolescence (ages 14–17) had worse number recall. However, other variables, including socioeconomic status, played a larger role (than maltreatment) on working and short-term memory. We conclude that a simple examination of “exposed” versus “unexposed” respondents may obscure potentially important within-group differences that are revealed by examining the effects of age at onset to maltreatment.\textless/p\ textgreater;,citation_author=Erin C Dunn;,citation_author=Daniel S Busso;,citation_author=Miriam R Raffeld;,citation_author=Jordan W Smoller;,citation_author=Charles A Nelson;,citation_author=Alysa E Doyle;,citation_author=Gigi Luk;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.10.014;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.10.014;,citation_issn=0145-2134;,citation_volume=51;,citation_journal_title=Child Abus.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Age differences in intra-individual variability in simple and choice reaction time: Systematic review and meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Background: Intra-individual variability in reaction time (RT IIV) is considered to be an index of central nervous system functioning. Such variability is elevated in neurodegenerative diseases or following traumatic brain injury. It has also been suggested to increase with age in healthy ageing. Objectives: To investigate and quantify age differences in RT IIV in healthy ageing; to examine the effect of different tasks and procedures; to compare raw and mean-adjusted measures of RT IIV. Data Sources: Four electronic databases: PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science and EMBASE, and hand searching of reference lists of relevant studies. Study Eligibility: English language journal articles, books or book chapters, containing quantitative empirical data on simple and/or choice RT IIV. Samples had to include younger (under 60 years) and older (60 years and above) human adults. Study Appraisal and Synthesis: Studies were evaluated in terms of sample representativeness and data treatment. Relevant data were extracted , using a specially-designed form, from the published report or obtained directly from the study authors. Age-group differences in raw and RT-mean-adjusted measures of simple and choice RT IIV were quantified using random effects meta-analyses. Results: Older adults (60+ years) had greater RT IIV than younger (20-39) and middle-aged (40-59) adults. Age effects were larger in choice RT tasks than in simple RT tasks. For all measures of RT IIV, effect sizes were larger for the comparisons between older and younger adults than between older and middle-aged adults, indicating that the age-related increases in RT IIV are not limited to old age. Effect sizes were also larger for raw than for RT-mean-adjusted RT IIV measures. Conclusions: RT IIV is greater among older adults. Some (but not all) of the age-related increases in RT IIV are accounted for by the increased RT means. © 2012 Dykiert et al.;,citation_author=Dominika Dykiert;,citation_author=Geoff Der;,citation_author=John M.

The Effect of Restricted Feedback;,citation_abstract=To examine whether the development of effective strategies during inspection time (IT) required active learning processes, we gave subjects an IT task involving false feedback. This IT task (ADIT) started at an exposure duration of 20 ms and gradually increased until subjects could reliably discriminate IT stimuli. False feedback about correctness of discrimination was introduced to make the ADIT task particularly difficult for individuals who were attempting to develop and refine an IT-related strategy. There was no difference between ITs derived from the ADIT and a standard IT task (VIT). There were no differences in ITs for subjects given either truthful or false feedback on the ADIT task. However, an interaction did exist between the feedback condition and the two IT tasks. This interaction indicated that subjects with ostensibly better VITs had poorer performance on ADIT, compared with those subjects who had truthful feedback. This finding suggests that false feedback can disrupt effective performance on IT. Self-reported strategy use had a significant independent effect on the observed IT measures.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of COMT Val 108/158 Met genotype on frontal lobe function and risk for schizophrenia;,citation_abstract=Abnormalities of prefrontal cortical function are prominent features of schizophrenia and have been associated with genetic risk, suggesting that susceptibility genes for schizophrenia may impact on the molecular mechanisms of prefrontal function. A potential susceptibility mechanism involves regulation of prefrontal dopamine, which modulates the response of prefrontal neurons during working memory. We examined the relationship of a common functional polymorphism (Val(108/158) Met) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, which accounts for a 4-fold variation in enzyme activity and dopamine catabolism, with both prefrontally mediated cognition and prefrontal cortical physiology. In 175 patients with schizophrenia, 219 unaffected siblings, and 55 controls, COMT genotype was related in allele dosage fashion to performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test of executive cognition and explained 4% of variance (P = 0.001) in frequency of perseverative errors. Consistent with other evidence that dopamine enhances prefrontal neuronal function, the load of the low-activity Met allele predicted enhanced cognitive performance. We then examined the effect of COMT genotype on prefrontal physiology during a working memory task in three separate subgroups (n = 11-16) assayed with functional MRI. Met allele load consistently predicted a more efficient physiological response in prefrontal cortex. Finally, in a family-based association analysis of 104 trios, we found a significant increase in transmission of the Val allele to the schizophrenic offspring. These data suggest that the COMT Val allele, because it increases prefrontal dopamine catabolism, impairs prefrontal cognition and physiology, and by this mechanism slightly increases risk for schizophrenia.;,citation_author=Michael F Egan;,citation_author=Terry E Goldberg;,citation_author=Bhaskar S Kolachana;,citation_author=Joseph H Callicott;,citation_author=Chiara M Mazzanti;,citation_author=Richard E Straub;,citation_author=David Goldman;,citation_author=Daniel R Weinberger;,citation_publication_date=2001;,citation_cover_date=2001;,citation_year=2001;,citation_fulltext_html_url=www.pnas.orgcgidoi10.1073pnas.111134598;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.111134598;,citation_issn=00278424;,citation_volume=98;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

Recent evidence also suggests visual attentional control for encoding into working memory may be selectively spared in people with schizophrenia (Gold et al., 2006). The current study used a cued backward masking task to investigate 23 people with schizophrenia and 27 healthy controls. People with schizophrenia were hypothesized to perform better on invalidly cued trials when making a simple identification or location judgment. However, we found schizophrenia impaired performance on both valid and invalid cues to the same degree whether the cue was a stored representation (top-down) or presented at the location of the stimulus (bottom-up). In contrast to a large neuropsychological literature, these findings suggest that people with schizophrenia show no specific spatial attentional control deficit.

As has been previously demonstrated in young adults, the Common EF factor was 100% heritable, which indicates that correlations among the four EF domains are entirely attributable to shared genetic etiology.

Structural equation modeling suggested that short-term and working memories reflect separate but highly related constructs and that many of the tasks used in the literature as working memory tasks reflect a common construct. Working memory shows a strong connection to fluid intelligence, but short-term memory does not. A theory of working memory capacity and general fluid intelligence is proposed: The authors argue that working memory capacity and fluid intelligence reflect the ability to keep a representation active, particularly in the face of interference and distraction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychosocial Interventions for Child Disruptive Behaviors:  A Meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Disruptive behavior disorders are among the most common child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and associated with significant impairment. OBJECTIVE: Systematically review studies of psychosocial interventions for children with disruptive behavior disorders. METHODS: We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers assessed studies against predetermined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by 1 team member and reviewed by a second. We categorized interventions as having only a child component, only a parent component, or as multicomponent interventions. RESULTS: Sixty-six studies were included. Twenty-eight met criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis. The effect size for the multicomponent interventions and interventions with only a parent component had the same estimated value, with a median of −1.2 SD reduction in outcome score (95% credible interval, −1.6 to −0.9). The estimate for interventions with only a child component was −1.0 SD (95% credible interval, −1.6 to −0.4). LIMITATIONS: Methodologic limitations of the available evidence (eg, inconsistent or incomplete outcome reporting, inadequate blinding or allocation concealment) may compromise the strength of the evidence. Population and intervention inclusion criteria and selected outcome measures eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis may limit applicability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 intervention categories were more effective than the control conditions. Interventions with a parent component, either alone or in combination with other components, were likely to have the largest effect. Although additional research is needed in the community setting, our findings suggest that the parent component is critical to successful intervention.;,citation_author=Richard A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychosocial and Pharmacologic Interventions for Disruptive Behavior in Children and Adolescents;,citation_abstract=We systematically reviewed evidence on psychosocial and/or pharmacologic treatment for children with disruptive behavior disorders., We searched MEDLINE® via PubMed® and PsycInfo®, as well as the reference lists of included studies. We used the Comparative Effectiveness Plus interface for the Iowa Drug Information Service (IDIS) database to identify regulatory information., We included studies published in English from January 1994 to June 2014, did dual data extraction, and rated risk of bias and strength of evidence of the literature in accordance with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methods Guide. We analyzed data qualitatively and quantitatively. Our quantitative analysis was based on a Bayesian estimation approach, and we therefore did not conduct statistical significance tests., We identified 84 unique studies that addressed one or more Key Questions. Of these, 66 studies assessed psychosocial interventions and 13 assessed pharmacologic interventions. The active treatment arms of studies of psychosocial interventions were categorized as interventions including only a child component (n = 2) or only a parent component (n = 25), or as multicomponent interventions (n = 39). Multicomponent interventions included were defined as including two or more of a child component, parent component, or other component (e.g., teacher, family together). All interventions included in this study that were categorized as multicomponent interventions included a parent component. Studies provided consistent evidence that multicomponent interventions and interventions including only a parent component resulted in significantly greater improvement on parent reports of child disruptive behavior than controls. Our quantitative analysis of the 28 of these studies that met additional criteria for inclusion in our Bayesian multivariate network meta-analysis indicated that all three intervention types were more effective than control conditions. The probability of being the best treatment (i.e., having the largest effect) was the same for multicomponent interventions (43%) and for interventions with only a parent component (43%), followed by interventions with only a child component (14%). Pharmacologic studies evaluated the effectiveness of antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and stimulants and nonstimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Studies of antipsychotic medications and valproic acid, an antiepileptic medication, had mixed results over the short term. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of atomoxetine suggested it was more effective at reducing oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms than placebo. One RCT of guanfacine extended release also reported significant reductions over placebo in ODD symptoms. Two RCTs reported that stimulants were more effective than placebo at reducing ODD and conduct disorder symptoms. We included related publications and an additional four studies to address harms and predictors of treatment effects., Qualitative and quantitative analyses generally suggest that psychosocial interventions for children with disruptive behavior disorders that include a parent component, either alone or in combination with other components, are likely to be more effective at reducing disruptive child behaviors than interventions that include only a child component or control conditions. Small studies of antipsychotics and stimulants report positive effects in the very short term. The most commonly reported outcomes are parent-reported outcomes. Long-term and functional outcomes were not consistently reported.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neurocognitive architecture of working memory;,citation_abstract=A crucial role for working memory in temporary information processing and guidance of complex behavior has been recognized for many decades. There is emerging consensus that working-memory maintenance results from the interactions among long-term memory representations and basic processes, including attention, that are instantiated as reentrant loops between frontal and posterior cortical areas, as well as sub-cortical structures. The nature of such interactions can account for capacity limitations, lifespan changes, and restricted transfer after working-memory training. Recent data and models indicate that working memory may also be based on synaptic plasticity and that working memory can operate on non-consciously perceived information.;,citation_author=Johan Eriksson;,citation_author=Edward K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Diagnostic classification of irritability and oppositionality in youth: A global field study comparing ICD-11 with ICD-10 and DSM-5;,citation_abstract=Background Severe irritability has become an important topic in child and adolescent mental health. Based on the available evidence and on public health considerations, WHO classified chronic irritability within oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in ICD-11, a solution markedly different from DSM-5’s (i.e. the new childhood mood diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [DMDD]) and from ICD-10’s (i.e. ODD as one of several conduct disorders without attention to irritability). In this study, we tested the accuracy with which a global, multilingual, multidisciplinary sample of clinicians were able to use the ICD-11 classification of chronic irritability and oppositionality as compared to the ICD-10 and DSM-5 approaches. Methods Clinicians (N = 196) from 48 countries participated in an Internet-based field study in English, Spanish, or Japanese and were randomized to review and use one of the three diagnostic systems. Through experimental manipulation of validated clinical vignettes, we evaluated how well clinicians in each condition could identify chronic irritability versus nonirritable oppositionality, episodic bipolar disorder, dysthymic depression, and normative irritability. Results Compared to ICD-10 and DSM-5, ICD-11 led to more accurate identification of severe irritability and better differentiation from boundary presentations. Participants using DSM-5 largely failed to apply the DMDD diagnosis when it was appropriate, and they more often applied psychopathological diagnoses to developmentally normative irritability. Conclusions The formulation of irritability and oppositionality put forth in ICD-11 shows evidence of clinical utility, supporting accurate diagnosis. Global mental health clinicians can readily identify ODD both with and without chronic irritability.;,citation_author=Spencer C. Evans;,citation_author=Michael C. Roberts;,citation_author=Jared W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Conduct disorder;,citation_abstract=Conduct disorder (CD) is a common and highly impairing psychiatric disorder that usually emerges in childhood or adolescence and is characterized by severe antisocial and aggressive behaviour. It frequently co-occurs with attention-d eficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and often leads to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. CD affects ~3% of schoolaged children and is twice as prevalent in males than in females. This disorder can be subtyped according to age at onset (childhood-o nset versus adolescent-onset) and the presence or absence of callous-unemotional traits (deficits in empathy and guilt). The aetiology of CD is complex, with contributions of both genetic and environmental risk factors and different forms of interplay among the two (gene–environment interaction and correlation). In addition , CD is associated with neurocognitive impairments; smaller grey matter volume in limbic regions such as the amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex, and functional abnormalities in overlapping brain circuits responsible for emotion processing, emotion regulation and reinforcement-based decision-making have been reported. Lower hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and autonomic reactivity to stress has also been reported. Management of CD primarily involves parent-b ased or family-based psychosocial interventions, although stimulants and atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used, especially in individuals with comorbid ADHD.;,citation_author=Graeme Fairchild;,citation_author=David J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder;,citation_abstract=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual’s lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=SLC25A24 gene methylation and gray matter volume in females with and without conduct disorder: An exploratory epigenetic neuroimaging study;,citation_abstract=Conduct disorder (CD), a psychiatric disorder characterized by a repetitive pattern of antisocial behaviors, results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. The clinical presentation of CD varies both according to the individual’s sex and level of callous-unemotional (CU) traits, but it remains unclear how genetic and environmental factors interact at the molecular level to produce these differences. Emerging evidence in males implicates methylation of genes associated with socio-affective processes. Here, we combined an epigenome-wide association study with structural neuroimaging in 51 females with CD and 59 typically developing (TD) females to examine DNA methylation in relation to CD, CU traits, and gray matter volume (GMV). We demonstrate an inverse pattern of correlation between CU traits and methylation of a chromosome 1 region in CD females (positive) as compared to TD females (negative). The identified region spans exon 1 of the SLC25A24 gene, central to energy metabolism due to its role in mitochondrial function. Increased SLC25A24 methylation was also related to lower GMV in multiple brain regions in the overall cohort. These included the superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, secondary visual cortex and ventral posterior cingulate cortex, which are regions that have previously been implicated in CD and CU traits. While our findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they provide novel evidence that CU traits in females are associated with methylation levels in a fundamentally different way in CD and TD individuals, which in turn may relate to observable variations in GMV across the brain.;,citation_author=Elizabeth Farrow;,citation_author=Andreas G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transcriptomic context of DRD1 is associated with prefrontal activity and behavior during working memory;,citation_abstract=Dopamine D 1 receptor (D 1 R) signaling shapes prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during working memory (WM). Previous reports found higher WM performance associated with alleles linked to greater expression of the gene coding for D 1 Rs ( DRD1 ). However, there is no evidence on the relationship between genetic modulation of DRD1 expression in PFC and patterns of prefrontal activity during WM. Furthermore, previous studies have not considered that D 1 Rs are part of a coregulated molecular environment, which may contribute to D 1 R-related prefrontal WM processing. Thus, we hypothesized a reciprocal link between a coregulated (i.e., coexpressed) molecular network including DRD1 and PFC activity. To explore this relationship, we used three independent postmortem prefrontal mRNA datasets (total n = 404) to characterize a coexpression network including DRD1 . Then, we indexed network coexpression using a measure (polygenic coexpression index— DRD1 -PCI) combining the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on coexpression. Finally, we associated the DRD1 -PCI with WM performance and related brain activity in independent samples of healthy participants (total n = 371). We identified and replicated a coexpression network including DRD1 , whose coexpression was correlated with DRD1 -PCI. We also found that DRD1 -PCI was associated with lower PFC activity and higher WM performance. Behavioral and imaging results were replicated in independent samples. These findings suggest that genetically predicted expression of DRD1 and of its coexpression partners stratifies healthy individuals in terms of WM performance and related prefrontal activity. They also highlight genes and SNPs potentially relevant to pharmacological trials aimed to test cognitive enhancers modulating DRD1 signaling.;,citation_author=Leonardo Fazio;,citation_author=Giulio Pergola;,citation_author=Marco Papalino;,citation_author=Pasquale Di Carlo;,citation_author=Anna Monda;,citation_author=Barbara Gelao;,citation_author=Nicola Amoroso;,citation_author=Sabina Tangaro;,citation_author=Antonio Rampino;,citation_author=Teresa Popolizio;,citation_author=Alessandro Bertolino;,citation_author=Giuseppe Blasi;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=21;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1717135115;,citation_issn=10916490;,citation_volume=115;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

However, less is known about the course of cognitive functioning before and after retirement and specifically whether job characteristics during one’s time of employment (i.e., higher vs. lower levels of mental work demands) moderate how cognition changes both before and after the transition to retirement. We used data from n = 4,182 (50 women) individuals in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative panel study in the United States, across an 18 year time span (1992-2010). Data were linked to the O NET occupation codes to gather information about mental job demands to examine whether job characteristics during one’s time of employment moderates level and rate of change in cognitive functioning (episodic memory and mental status) both before and after retirement. Results indicated that working in an occupation characterized by higher levels of mental demands was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning before retirement, and a slower rate of cognitive decline after retirement. We controlled for a number of important covariates, including socioeconomic (education and income), demographic, and health variables. Our discussion focuses on pathways through which job characteristics may be associated with the course of cognitive functioning in relation to the important transition of retirement.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Audio-visual spatial alignment improves integration in the presence of a competing audio-visual stimulus;,citation_abstract=In order to parse the world around us, we must constantly determine which sensory inputs arise from the same physical source and should therefore be perceptually integrated. Temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimuli drives audio-visual (AV) integration, but the role played by AV spatial alignment is less well understood. Here, we manipulated AV spatial alignment and collected electroencephalography (EEG) data while human subjects performed a free-field variant of the “pip and pop” AV search task. In this paradigm, visual search is aided by a spatially uninformative auditory tone, the onsets of which are synchronized to changes in the visual target. In Experiment 1, tones were either spatially aligned or spatially misaligned with the visual display. Regardless of AV spatial alignment, we replicated the key pip and pop result of improved AV search times. Mirroring the behavioral results, we found an enhancement of early event-related potentials (ERPs), particularly the auditory N1 component, in both AV conditions. We demonstrate that both top-down and bottom-up attention contribute to these N1 enhancements. In Experiment 2, we tested whether spatial alignment influences AV integration in a more challenging context with competing multisensory stimuli. An AV foil was added that visually resembled the target and was synchronized to its own stream of synchronous tones. The visual com­ ponents of the AV target and AV foil occurred in opposite hemifields; the two auditory components were also in opposite hemifields and were either spatially aligned or spatially misaligned with the visual components to which they were synchronized. Search was fastest when the auditory and visual components of the AV target (and the foil) were spatially aligned. Attention modulated ERPs in both spatial conditions, but importantly, the scalp topography of early evoked responses shifted only when stimulus components were spatially aligned, signaling the recruitment of different neural generators likely related to multisensory integration. These results suggest that AV integration depends on AV spatial alignment when stimuli in both modalities compete for se­ lective integration, a common scenario in real-world perception.;,citation_author=Justin T.

Psychiatric outcomes in adulthood;,citation_abstract=Notes that strong links exist between juvenile and adult depression but comorbid conduct disorder in childhood may mitigate this continuity. This study tested the impact of comorbid conduct disorder on psychiatric adult outcomes. A group of 149 Ss assessed at the Maudsley Hospital in the period 1970–1983 and meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder with (n=) or without (n=) conduct disorder were interviewed 20 yrs later. Data were collected on the lifetime history of psychiatric disorders. Results show that adult depressive recurrence was high for major depression (62.4%) and any depression (75.2%), and survival analyses showed no difference between the 2 groups. The group with conduct disorders had higher rates of drug misuse and dependence, alcoholism and antisocial personality disorders. It is concluded that adolescent depression carries an elevated risk of adult depression irrespective of comorbidity. Comorbid conduct disorder in childhood is associated with raised rates of other psychiatric outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of nutrients, dietary supplements and vitamins on cognition: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that various nutrients, dietary supplements, and vitamins may delay the onset of age-associated cognitive decline and dementia. We systematically reviewed recent randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of nutritional interventions on cognitive performance in older non-demented adults. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 2003 and 2013. We included randomized trials of ≥ 3 months’ duration that examined the cognitive effects of a nutritional intervention in non-demented adults \textgreater 40 years of age. Meta-analyses were done when sufficient trials were available. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials met inclusion criteria (six omega-3 fatty acids, seven B vitamins, three vitamin E, eight other interventions). In the meta-analyses, omega-3 fatty acids showed no significant effect on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (four trials, mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.08 - 0.19) or digit span forward (three trials, mean difference -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 - 0.25), while B vitamins showed no significant effect on MMSE scores (three trials, mean difference 0.02, 95% CI -0.22 - 0.25). None of the vitamin E studies reported significant effects on cognitive outcomes. Among the other nutritional interventions, statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups on at least one cognitive domain were found in single studies of green tea extract, Concord grape juice, chromium picolinate, beta-carotene, two different combinations of multiple vitamins, and a dietary approach developed for the control of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and vitamin E supplementation did not affect cognition in non-demented middle-aged and older adults. Other nutritional interventions require further evaluation before their use can be advocated for the prevention of age-associated cognitive decline and dementia.;,citation_author=Scott C Forbes;,citation_author=Jayna M Holroyd-Leduc;,citation_author=Marc J Poulin;,citation_author=David B Hogan;,citation_publication_date=2015-12;,citation_cover_date=2015-12;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740832

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Live fast, die young? A review on the developmental trajectories of ADHD across the lifespan;,citation_abstract=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is highly heritable and the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. In recent decades, it has been appreciated that in a substantial number of cases the disorder does not remit in puberty, but persists into adulthood. Both in childhood and adulthood, ADHD is characterised by substantial comorbidity including substance use , depression, anxiety, and accidents. However, course and symptoms of the disorder and the comorbidities may fluctuate and change over time, and even age of onset in childhood has recently been questioned. Available evidence to date is poor and largely inconsistent with regard to the predictors of persistence versus remittance. Likewise, the development of comorbid disorders cannot be foreseen early on, hampering preventive measures. These facts call for a lifespan perspective on ADHD from childhood to old age. In this selective review, we summarise current knowledge of the long-term course of ADHD, with an emphasis on clinical symptom and cognitive trajectories, treatment effects over the lifespan, and the development of comorbidities. Also, we summarise current knowledge and important unresolved issues on biological factors underlying different ADHD trajectories. We conclude that a severe lack of knowledge on lifespan aspects in ADHD still exists for nearly every aspect reviewed. We encourage large-scale research efforts to overcome those knowledge gaps through appropriately granular longitudinal studies.;,citation_author=Barbara Franke;,citation_author=Giorgia Michelini;,citation_author=Philip Asherson;,citation_author=Tobias Banaschewski;,citation_author=Andrea Bilbow;,citation_author=Jan K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder in a Community Mental Health Clinic: Prevalence, Comorbidity and Correlates;,citation_abstract=Objective: The revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) added a new diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) to depressive disorders. This study examines the prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of the new disorder, with a particular focus on its overlap with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), with which DMDD shares core symptoms. Methods: Data were obtained from 597 youth 6–18 years of age who participated in a systematic assessment of symptoms offered to all intakes at a community mental health center (sample accrued from July 2003 to March 2008). Assessment included diagnostic, symptomatic, and functional measures. DMDD was diagnosed using a post-hoc definition from item-level ratings on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children that closely matches the DSM-5 definition. Caregivers rated youth on the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Approximately 31% of youth met the operational definition of DMDD, and 40% had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) diagnoses of ODD. Youth with DMDD almost always had ODD (odds ratio [OR] = 53.84) and displayed higher rates of comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder than youth without DMDD. Caregivers of youth with DMDD reported more symptoms of aggressive behavior, rule-breaking, social problems, anxiety/depression, attention problems, and thought problems than all other youth without DMDD. Compared with youth with ODD, youth with DMDD were not significantly different in terms of categorical or dimensional approaches to comorbidity and impairment. Conclusions: The new diagnosis of DMDD might be common in community mental health clinics. Youth with DMDD displayed more severe symptoms and poorer functioning than youth without DMDD. However, DMDD almost entirely overlaps with ODD and youth with DMDD were not significantly different than youth with ODD. These findings raise concerns about the potentially confusing effects of using DMDD in clinical settings, particularly given that DSM-5 groups DMDD with depressive disorders, but ODD remains a disruptive behavior disorder, potentially changing the decision-making framework that clinicians use to select treatments.;,citation_author=Andrew J.

MiXeR results are presented as a Venn diagram of unique and shared polygenic components across traits. At 90% of SNP-heritability explained for each phenotype, MiXeR estimates that 8.3 K variants causally influence schizophrenia and 6.4 K influence bipolar disorder. Among these variants, 6.2 K are shared between the disorders, which have a high genetic correlation. Further, MiXeR uncovers polygenic overlap between schizophrenia and educational attainment. Despite a genetic correlation close to zero , the phenotypes share 8.3 K causal variants, while 2.5 K additional variants influence only educational attainment. By considering the polygenicity, discoverability and heritability of complex phenotypes, MiXeR analysis may improve our understanding of cross-trait genetic architectures.;,citation_author=Oleksandr Frei;,citation_author=Dominic Holland;,citation_author=Olav B.

The present multivariate twin study of three executive functions (inhibiting dominant responses, updating working memory representations, and shifting between task sets), measured as latent variables, examined why people vary in these executive control abilities and why these abilities are correlated but separable from a behavioral genetic perspective. Results indicated that executive functions are correlated because they are influenced by a highly heritable (99%) common factor that goes beyond general intelligence or perceptual speed, and they are separable because of additional genetic influences unique to particular executive functions. This combination of general and specific genetic influences places executive functions among the most heritable psychological traits. These results highlight the potential of genetic approaches for uncovering the biological underpinnings of executive functions and suggest a need for examining multiple types of executive functions to distinguish different levels of genetic influences.;,citation_author=Naomi P Friedman;,citation_author=Akira Miyake;,citation_author=Susan E Young;,citation_author=John C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reaction time and onset of psychological distress: The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey;,citation_abstract=Background Cross-sectional studies have shown that depression is often accompanied by less efficient cognitive function, as indicated by slower speed of information processing. The direction of effect is unclear. We investigated prospectively whether slower processing speed, as indexed by longer simple or choice reaction time, is associated with an increased risk of psychological distress. Methods Participants were 3088 men and women aged 18 and over who had taken part in the UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Simple and choice reaction time was measured in the baseline survey. Symptoms of psychological distress were assessed at baseline and at the 7-year follow-up survey with the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results In unadjusted models, a SD slower simple or choice reaction time at baseline was associated with ORs for psychological distress (≥ 5 on GHQ) at follow-up of 1.14 (1.06 to 1.23; p ¡ 0.001) or 1.13 (1.04 to 1.22; p=0.002), respectively. Further adjustment for age, sex, social class, educational attainment, health behaviours, number of chronic physical illnesses present, neuroticism and GHQ score at baseline had only slight attenuating effects on these associations. In fully adjusted models, a SD slower simple or choice reaction time at baseline was associated with ORs for psychological distress of 1.11 (1.02 to 1.21; p=0.017) or 1.11 (1.00 to 1.24; p=0.048), respectively.

The cognitive profile of the large and growing population of older adults with prior TBI who do not have a diagnosis of dementia, however, has not been well described.

Mean time since first TBI was 38 ± 19 y. Outcomes assessed included measures of global cognitive function, verbal episodic memory, semantic fluency, and calculation as well as a measure of subjective memory (&amp;amp;amp;quot;How would you rate your memory at the present time?&amp;quot;). We compared outcomes between the two TBI groups using regression models adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, and depression. Sensitivity analyses were performed stratified by TBI severity (no TBI, TBI without loss of consciousness [LOC], and TBI with LOC). Respondents with TBI were younger (mean age 64 ± 10 y versus 68 ± 11 y), were less likely to be female, and had higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and depression than respondents without TBI. Respondents with TBI did not perform significantly differently from respondents without TBI on any measure of objective cognitive function in either raw or adjusted models (fully adjusted: global cognitive function score 15.4 versus 15.2, p = 0.68; verbal episodic memory score 4.4 versus 4.3, p = 0.79; semantic fluency score 15.7 versus 14.0, p = 0.21; calculation impairment 22% versus 26%, risk ratio [RR] [95% CI] = 0.86 [0.67-1.11], p = 0.24). Sensitivity analyses stratified by TBI severity produced similar results. TBI was associated with significantly increased risk for subjective memory impairment in models adjusted for demographics and medical comorbidities (29% versus 24%; RR [95% CI]: 1.26 [1.02-1.57], p = 0.036). After further adjustment for active depression, however, risk for subjective memory impairment was no longer significant (RR [95% CI]: 1.18 [0.95-1.47], p = 0.13). Sensitivity analyses revealed that risk of subjective memory impairment was increased only among respondents with TBI with LOC and not among those with TBI without LOC. Furthermore, the risk of subjective memory impairment was significantly greater among those with TBI with LOC versus those without TBI even after adjustment for depression (RR [95% CI]: partially adjusted, 1.38 [1.09-1.74], p = 0.008; fully adjusted, 1.28 [1.01-1.61], p = 0.039).\textless/p \textgreater\textlessp\ textgreater\textlessb\ textgreaterCONCLUSIONS: \textless/b\ textgreaterIn this population-based study of community-dwelling older adults without dementia, those with prior TBI with LOC were more likely to report subjective memory impairment compared to those without TBI even after adjustment for demographics, medical comorbidities, and active depression. Lack of greater objective cognitive impairment among those with versus without TBI may be due to poor sensitivity of the cognitive battery or survival bias, or may suggest that post-TBI cognitive impairment primarily affects executive function and processing speed, which were not rigorously assessed in this study.

Study design We analyzed data from the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) to report nationally representative prevalence estimates of each condition among children aged 3-17 years and receipt of treatment by a mental health professional. Parents/caregivers reported whether their children had ever been diagnosed with each of the 3 conditions and whether they currently have the condition. Bivariate analyses were used to examine the prevalence of conditions and treatment according to sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. The independent associations of these characteristics with both the current disorder and utilization of treatment were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results Among children aged 3-17 years, 7.1% had current anxiety problems, 7.4% had a current behavioral/ conduct problem, and 3.2% had current depression. The prevalence of each disorder was higher with older age and poorer child health or parent/caregiver mental/emotional health; condition-specific variations were observed in the association between other characteristics and the likelihood of disorder. Nearly 80% of those with depression received treatment in the previous year, compared with 59.3% of those with anxiety problems and 53.5% of those with behavioral/conduct problems. Model-adjusted effects indicated that condition severity and presence of a comorbid mental disorder were associated with treatment receipt. Conclusions The latest nationally representative data from the NSCH show that depression, anxiety, and behavioral/ conduct problems are prevalent among US children and adolescents. Treatment gaps remain, particularly for anxiety and behavioral/conduct problems. (J Pediatr 2019;206:256-67).;,citation_author=Reem M. Ghandour;,citation_author=Laura J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genome-wide association scan identifies new variants associated with a cognitive predictor of dyslexia.;,citation_abstract=Developmental dyslexia (DD) is one of the most prevalent learning disorders, with high impact on school and psychosocial development and high comorbidity with conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. DD is characterized by deficits in different cognitive skills, including word reading, spelling, rapid naming, and phonology. To investigate the genetic basis of DD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these skills within one of the largest studies available, including nine cohorts of reading-impaired and typically developing children of European ancestry (N = 2562-3468). We observed a genome-wide significant effect (p \ textless 1 × 10-8) on rapid automatized naming of letters (RANlet) for variants on 18q12.2, within MIR924HG (micro-RNA 924 host gene; rs17663182 p = 4.73 × 10-9), and a suggestive association on 8q12.3 within NKAIN3 (encoding a cation transporter; rs16928927, p = 2.25 × 10-8). rs17663182 (18q12.2) also showed genome-wide significant multivariate associations with RAN measures (p = 1.15 × 10-8) and with all the cognitive traits tested (p = 3.07 × 10-8), suggesting (relational) pleiotropic effects of this variant. A polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed significant genetic overlaps of some of the DD-related traits with educational attainment (EDUyears) and ADHD. Reading and spelling abilities were positively associated with EDUyears (p ∼ [10-5-10-7]) and negatively associated with ADHD PRS (p ∼ [10-8-10-17]). This corroborates a long-standing hypothesis on the partly shared genetic etiology of DD and ADHD, at the genome-wide level. Our findings suggest new candidate DD susceptibility genes and provide new insights into the genetics of dyslexia and its comorbities.;,citation_author=Alessandro Gialluisi;,citation_author=Till F.

This could help narrow the gap between laboratory settings and observations in real world contexts and thus allow for generalization of laboratory results to everyday life. A binary decision task with quasi realistic context and stimuli was created to investigate neural processing of certain and uncertain decision making, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. On the basis of behavioral data (consistency of decisions in identical contexts), trials with uncertain and certain decision making were identified. This allowed for comparing uncertain and certain conditions, and contrasting each condition with a low level baseline (i.e., between trial fixation dot). A Conjunction analysis between contrasts of uncertainty versus baseline and certainty versus baseline indicated a large overlap of neural network recruitment distributed in bilateral middle frontal, medial frontal , inferior parietal, occipito-temporal, and medio-temporal areas, and the cingulate cortex. While basic neural processing principles in uncertain and certain contexts were comparable, the direct contrast revealed activation foci in middle cingulate and in frontal and parietal areas. The quasi realistic approach revealed a common network for decision making which is modulated by uncertainty.;,citation_author=K. Gloy;,citation_author=M. Herrmann;,citation_author=T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Age-related slowing: Perceptuomotor, decision, or attention decline?;,citation_abstract=Age-related slowing is well documented but its origin remains unclear. A first validation study (Study 1) performed in 46 participants examined the effect of attention allocation (manipulated through a dual task) on various portions of individual simple reaction time (SRT) distribution (minimum, centile 5, centile 50, and centile 95 RTs). It showed that attention ’deprivation’ due to a secondary task is not uniform throughout the distribution but impaired mainly the ability to produce a large number of fast responses. Study 2 investigated in 88 healthy participants age-related slowing of perceptual, motor, decision, and attentional processes using SRT and choice reaction time (CRT), finger tapping, and visual inspection time tests. It showed that the majority of SRT slowing after the age of 40 is due to lengthening of centile 5 RT, suggesting perceptuomotor slowing, an interpretation supported by longer visual inspection time and lower tapping frequency. After 60 years, SRT lengthening was due to a further lengthening of the centile 5-centile 50 SRT index, suggesting the participation of attentional decline. These findings support the hypothesis that age-related slowing in simple repetitive tasks is mainly related to slowing at the stage of perceptuomotor processes, and after 60 years, to additional decline of attention.;,citation_author=Olivier Godefroy;,citation_author=Martine Roussel;,citation_author=Pascal Despretz;,citation_author=Veronique Quaglino;,citation_author=Muriel Boucart;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1080/03610731003613615;,citation_isbn=0361073100;,citation_issn=0361073X;,citation_volume=36;,citation_journal_title=Experimental Aging Research;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dialectical behavior therapy alters emotion regulation and amygdala activity in patients with borderline personality disorder;,citation_abstract=Objective: Siever and Davis’ (1991) psychobiological framework of borderline personality disorder (BPD) identifies affective instability (AI) as a core dimension characterized by prolonged and intense emotional reactivity. Recently, deficient amygdala habituation, defined as a change in response to repeated relative to novel unpleasant pictures within a session, has emerged as a biological correlate of AI in BPD. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment, targets AI by teaching emotion-regulation skills. This study tested the hypothesis that BPD patients would exhibit decreased amygdala activation and improved habituation, as well as improved emotion regulation with standard 12-month DBT. Methods: Event-related fMRI was obtained pre- and post-12-months of standard-DBT in unmedicated BPD patients. Healthy controls (HCs) were studied as a benchmark for normal amygdala activity and change over time (n ¼ 11 per diagnostic-group). During each scan, participants viewed an intermixed series of unpleasant, neutral and pleasant pictures presented twice (novel, repeat). Change in emotion regulation was measured with the Difficulty in Emotion Regulation (DERS) scale. Results: fMRI results showed the predicted Group Â Time interaction: compared with HCs, BPD patients exhibited decreased amygdala activation with treatment. This post-treatment amygdala reduction in BPD was observed for all three pictures types, but particularly marked in the left hemisphere and during repeated-emotional pictures. Emotion regulation measured with the DERS significantly improved with DBT in BPD patients. Improved amygdala habituation to repeated-unpleasant pictures in patients was associated with improved overall emotional regulation measured by the DERS (total score and emotion regulation strategy use subscale). Conclusion: These findings have promising treatment implications and support the notion that DBT targets amygdala hyperactivitydpart of the disturbed neural circuitry underlying emotional dysregulation in BPD. Future work includes examining how DBT-induced amygdala changes interact with frontal-lobe regions implicated in emotion regulation.;,citation_author=Marianne Goodman;,citation_author=David Carpenter;,citation_author=Cheuk Y.

Patients with mild AD were compared with controls on a choice reaction time task, both cued (CCRT) and uncued (CRT). Initial and 1-year followup data were analyzed both as mean reaction times and as parameters of a fitted two-component quantitative model (the ex-Gaussian model). Slowing of CRT proved to be a sensitive test for AD. Slowing was due to changes in both the sensory/motor and the decisional components of the CRT model. However, these changes were found in both AD and slower, older controls. The modeling of CRT in AD is discussed.;,citation_author=B. Gordon;,citation_author=K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of a smartphone app-augmented treatment for children with oppositional defiant disorder / conduct disorder and peer-related aggressive behavior – a pilot study;,citation_abstract=Social competence training interventions, especially child-focused ones, have proven to be effective in the treatment of children with conduct disorder. Therapy homework assignments implemented between the therapy sessions are essential for practicing strategies developed during treatment sessions and transferring them to everyday life. However, clinical experience shows that patients’ adherence regarding these assignments is often low, thus diminishing the treatment success. One obstacle in this regard is a lack of motivation. The use of smartphone apps in the context of child and adolescent psychotherapy is relatively new, and may provide novel ways to improve the transfer of coping strategies to daily life between treatment sessions. However, only a small number of high-quality studies have analyzed the systematic use of smartphone apps in therapy. The present study will therefore evaluate patients’ homework assignment adherence when using a smartphone app as compared to a paper-and-pencil method. The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a smartphone app on the adherence to therapy homework assignments (n = 35) in the treatment of children with aggressive behavior aged 6–12 years compared to paper-and-pencil homework assignments (n = 35). This trial is intended as a pilot study and aims to provide a basis for a subsequent multicenter trial. However , the results may already lead to recommendations for the development and use of mental health-related smartphone apps for children and adolescents with aggressive behavior problems.

Genomic SEM synthesizes genetic correlations and single-nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities inferred from GWAS summary statistics of individual traits from samples with varying and unknown degrees of overlap. Genomic SEM can be used to model multivariate genetic associations among phenotypes, identify variants with effects on general dimensions of cross-trait liability, calculate more predictive polygenic scores and identify loci that cause divergence between traits. We demonstrate several applications of genomic SEM, including a joint analysis of summary statistics from five psychiatric traits. We identify 27 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms not previously identified in the contributing univariate GWASs. Polygenic scores from genomic SEM consistently outperform those from univariate GWASs. Genomic SEM is flexible and open ended, and allows for continuous innovation in multivariate genetic analysis.;,citation_author=Andrew D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of common genetic risk variants for autism spectrum disorder;,citation_abstract=Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluating the current state of Mendelian randomization studies: A protocol for a systematic review on methodological and clinical aspects using neurodegenerative disorders as outcome;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND Mendelian randomization (MR) is fast becoming a popular method to judge causality from routinely conducted observational studies. However, stringent underlying statistical assumptions, missing biological information, and high sample size requirement might make it prone to misuse. Furthermore, rapidly updating methodologies and increasingly available datasets to researchers are making the interpretations of heterogeneous results even more complicated. In this protocol, we provide our design for a multifaceted systematic review on MR studies using neurodegenerative disease as an example outcome. The planned systematic review which has already passed the pilot stage will help to develop an in-depth understanding of how various MR methods have been applied, what has been achieved, and what can be done in future for to arrive at true causal risk factors. METHODS During the pilot phase of this systematic review, several versions of questionnaires and frequent consultations between reviewers helped us to finalize a comprehensive list of questions. This will be used to extract information on systematically searched MR articles investigating causality underlying neurodegenerative diseases. A literature search of the electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and databases listed in the Cochrane library) will be conducted. The search strategy will include terms related to MR and the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies, and three will extract the data. The included studies will be further judged by two reviewers for accuracy and completeness of available information. We will perform descriptive and quantitative synthesis using sensitivity analyses of causal association by study design, selection of genetic instrument, validity of MR assumptions, MR method, and sensitivity analysis based on exclusion of potential pleiotropic variants. The quality of conduct as well as quality of reporting in the included studies will be assessed and reported. A meta-analysis will be conducted, if effect estimates on identical genetic instruments are available for both exposure and outcome in the studies using data from participants from ethnically similar populations. DISCUSSION This systematic review protocol utilizes a unique comprehensive data abstraction tool based on recent methodological advancements in the field of MR. The planned systematic review will further integrate information on methodological details with clinical findings in latest available large-scale genome-wide association study datasets. Our findings aim to help raising awareness and promoting transparent reporting of MR studies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology consensus conference statement on uniform labeling of performance test scores;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Descriptive labels of performance test scores are a critical component of communicating outcomes of neuropsychological and psychological evaluations. Yet, no universally accepted system exists for assigning qualitative descriptors to scores in specific ranges. In addition, the definition and use of the term “impairment” lacks specificity and consensus. Consequently, test score labels and the denotation of impairment are inconsistently applied by clinicians, creating confusion among consumers of neuropsychological services, including referral sources, trainees, colleagues, and the judicial system. To reduce this confusion, experts in clinical and forensic neuropsychological and psychological assessment convened in a consensus conference at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN). The goals of the consensus conference were to recommend (1) a system of qualitative labels to describe results from performance-based tests with normal and non-normal distributions and (2) a definition of impairment and its application in individual case determinations.;,citation_author=Thomas J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic and Environmental Influences on Verbal Fluency in  Middle Age: A Longitudinal Twin Study;,citation_abstract=© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Mounting evidence suggests that measures of phonemic fluency and semantic fluency are differentially associated with other cognitive and health phenotypes, but few studies have examined their shared and unique variance, especially using genetically-informative designs. In this study, 1464 middle-aged twins completed six fluency subtests at up to two time-points (mean age 56 and 62 years). Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor solution: a General Fluency latent factor explained variation in all six subtests and a Semantic-Specific factor accounted for additional variance in semantic subtests. Both factors were explained primarily by genetic influences at both waves (a 2 = 0.57–0.76). There was considerable stability of individual differences over 6 years (r =.90 for General Fluency, r =.81 for Semantic-Specific), especially for genetic influences (r g =.94 and 1.0, respectively). These results suggest that semantic fluency can be viewed as a combination of general and semantic-specific variance, but phonemic fluency is captured entirely by the general factor.;,citation_author=Daniel E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Computerized and fingertip measures of reaction time compared in individuals;,citation_abstract=The main purpose of our study was to discover the correlation between the field fingertip and computerized methods of measuring reaction time selectively of the dominant and non-dominant hands for individual, non-trained, healthy young people of senior school age. Forty one, 17 year old, strongly right handed scholars, 21 boys and 20 girls with body mass indices between 18.5 and 25.0, participated in the experiment. The field fingertip method employed a metal metric ruler and the computerized method used the Vienna Test System. The point biserial coefficient of correlation between these two methods was calculated for each individual. The results of demonstrated that the vast majority of participants, 95.2% of males and 85.0% of females for the right hand and 95.2% of males and 95.0% of females for the left hand had a high level of point biserial coefficient of correlation between the two methods. A small number of participants, 3 females and 1 male, did not demonstrate a high level of correlation. We speculate that this fact may be due to differential expression of muscle fibre types between males and females. The portability and ease of use of the field fingertip method are advantageous in the field research and provide a reliable measure of reaction time. It is important to control the initial gap between the thumb and index finger of the person being tested. A metallic metric ruler is adequate experimental instrumentation.

A community sample of children (n = 316) enrolled between ages 10 and 13 completed four annual assessments of WM. Lower parental education, but not neighborhood disadvantage, was associated with worse WM performance. Neither measure of SES was associated with the rate of developmental change. Consequently, the SES disparity in WM is not a developmental lag that narrows or an accumulating effect that becomes more pronounced.

The analyses provided no evidence for casual associations from health to cognitive ability. In the other direction, higher educational attainment predicted lower BMI, systolic blood pressure , coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and taller stature. The analyses indicated no causal association from educational attainment to physical health.

The single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability estimates for trail-making measures were 7.9% (part A), 22.4% (part B) and 17.6 % (part B-part A). Significant genetic correlations were identified between trail-making measures and verbal-numerical reasoning (rg\textgreater0.6), general cognitive function (rg\textgreater0.6), processing speed (rg \textgreater0.7) and memory (rg\ textgreater0.3). Polygenic profile analysis indicated considerable shared genetic aetiology between trail making, general cognitive function, processing speed and memory (standardized β between 0.03 and 0.08). These results suggest that trail making is both phenotypically and genetically strongly associated with general cognitive function and processing speed.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 19 September 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.189.;,citation_author=S.

We hypothesized that measures of executive processes would parallel adolescent clinical status, with ADHD-persisters, but not remitters, differing significantly from controls. In contrast, persisters and remitters were hypothesized to perform similarly, and different from controls, on tasks requiring less effortful processing. METHODS: Ninety-eight participants diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were reevaluated approximately 10 years later. Eighty-five never-ADHD controls similar in age, IQ, and sex distribution served as a comparison group. Participants were administered a psychiatric interview and neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: Those with childhood ADHD demonstrated broad neuropsychological deficits relative to controls. When the group with childhood ADHD was subdivided based on adolescent ADHD status, compared to controls, both persisters and remitters showed deficient perceptual sensitivity and response variability, and increased ankle movements recorded by a solid-state actigraph. Only persisters differed from controls on several measures of more effortful executive processes.

The mechanisms by which this cycle is generated are incompletely understood. We found that a transient increase of dopamine (DA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during NREM sleep terminates NREM sleep and initiates REM sleep. DA acts on dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2)–expressing neurons in the BLA to induce the NREM-to-REM transition. This mechanism also plays a role in cataplectic attacks—a pathological intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness—in narcoleptics. These results show a critical role of DA signaling in the BLA in initiating REM sleep and provide a neuronal basis for sleep cycle generation. , Dopamine and the gating of REM sleep Sleep is composed of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep, and REM sleep usually appears after periods of non-REM sleep. However, we do not understand the mechanisms by which the brain cycles between those states. Using fiber photometry, Hasegawa et al . found increases in dopamine activation before non-REM to REM transitions but not before non-REM to wake transitions in the basolateral amygdala (see the Perspective by Arrigoni and Fuller).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The neurobiology of uncertainty: Implications for statistical learning;,citation_abstract=The capacity for assessing the degree of uncertainty in the environment relies on estimating statistics of temporally unfolding inputs. This, in turn, allows calibration of predictive and bottom-up processing, and signalling changes in temporally unfolding environmental features. In the last decade, several studies have examined how the brain codes for and responds to input uncertainty. Initial neurobiological experiments implicated frontoparietal and hippocampal systems, based largely on paradigms that manipulated distributional features of visual stimuli. However , later work in the auditory domain pointed to different systems, whose activation profiles have interesting implications for computational and neurobiological models of statistical learning (SL). This review begins by briefly recapping the historical development of ideas pertaining to the sensitivity to uncertainty in temporally unfolding inputs. It then discusses several issues at the interface of studies of uncertainty and SL. Following, it presents several current treatments of the neurobiology of uncertainty and reviews recent findings that point to principles that serve as important constraints on future neurobiological theories of uncertainty, and relatedly, SL. This review suggests it may be useful to establish closer links between neurobiological research on uncertainty and SL, considering particularly mechanisms sensitive to local and global structure in inputs, the degree of input uncertainty, the complexity of the system generating the input, learning mechanisms that operate on different temporal scales and the use of learnt information for online prediction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Common genetic variation and schizophrenia polygenic risk influence neurocognitive performance in young adulthood.;,citation_abstract=© 2015 The Authors American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Neurocognitive abilities constitute complex traits with considerable heritability. Impaired neurocognition is typically observed in schizophrenia (SZ), whereas convergent evidence has shown shared genetic determinants between neurocognition and SZ. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on neuropsychological and oculomotor traits, linked to SZ, in a general population sample of healthy young males (n=1079). Follow-up genotyping was performed in an identically phenotyped internal sample (n=738) and an independent cohort of young males with comparable neuropsychological measures (n=825). Heritability estimates were determined based on genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and potential regulatory effects on gene expression were assessed in human brain. Correlations with general cognitive ability and SZ risk polygenic scores were tested utilizing meta-analysis GWAS results by the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-SZ). The GWAS results implicated biologically relevant genetic loci encoding protein targets involved in synaptic neurotransmission, although no robust individual replication was detected and thus additional validation is required. Secondary permutation-based analysis revealed an excess of strongly associated loci among GWAS top-ranked signals for verbal working memory (WM) and antisaccade intra-subject reaction time variability (empirical P\textless0.001), suggesting multiple true-positive single-SNP associations. Substantial heritability was observed for WM performance. Further, sustained attention/vigilance and WM were suggestively correlated with both COGENT and PGC-SZ derived polygenic scores. Overall, these results imply that common genetic variation explains some of the variability in neurocognitive functioning among young adults, particularly WM, and provide supportive evidence that increased SZ genetic risk predicts neurocognitive fluctuations in the general population.;,citation_author=Alex Hatzimanolis;,citation_author=Pallav Bhatnagar;,citation_author=Anna Moes;,citation_author=Ruihua Wang;,citation_author=Panos Roussos;,citation_author=Panos Bitsios;,citation_author=Costas N.

Working memory deficits are characteristic for many psychiatric disorders. We performed genome-wide gene set enrichment analyses in multiple independent data sets of young and aged cognitively healthy subjects (n = 2,824) and in a large schizophrenia case-control sample (n = 32,143). The voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set, consisting of genes related to neuronal excitability, was robustly linked to performance in working memory-related tasks across ages and to schizophrenia. Functional brain imaging in 707 healthy participants linked this gene set also to working memory-related activity in the parietal cortex and the cerebellum. Gene set analyses may help to dissect the molecular underpinnings of cognitive dimensions, brain activity, and psychopathology. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Angela Heck;,citation_author=Matthias Fastenrath;,citation_author=Sandra Ackermann;,citation_author=Bianca Auschra;,citation_author=Horst Bickel;,citation_author=David Coynel;,citation_author=Leo Gschwind;,citation_author=Frank Jessen;,citation_author=Hanna Kaduszkiewicz;,citation_author=Wolfgang Maier;,citation_author=Annette Milnik;,citation_author=Michael Pentzek;,citation_author=Steffi G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The speed-accuracy tradeoff: History, physiology, methodology, and behavior;,citation_abstract=There are few behavioral effects as ubiquitous as the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). From insects to rodents to primates, the tendency for decision speed to covary with decision accuracy seems an inescapable property of choice behavior. Recently, the SAT has received renewed interest, as neuroscience approaches begin to uncover its neural underpinnings and computational models are compelled to incorporate it as a necessary benchmark. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of SAT. First, I trace its history as a tractable behavioral phenomenon and the role it has played in shaping mathematical descriptions of the decision process. Second, I present a &amp;amp;amp;quot;users guide&amp;quot; of SAT methodology, including a critical review of common experimental manipulations and analysis techniques and a treatment of the typical behavioral patterns that emerge when SAT is manipulated directly. Finally, I review applications of this methodology in several domains. © 2014 Heitz.;,citation_author=Richard P Heitz;,citation_publication_date=2014-06;,citation_cover_date=2014-06;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=www.frontiersin.org

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The MR-base platform supports systematic causal inference across the human phenome;,citation_abstract=Results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used to infer causal relationships between phenotypes, using a strategy known as 2-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) and bypassing the need for individual-level data. However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.Our health is affected by many exposures and risk factors, including aspects of our lifestyles, our environments, and our biology. It can, however, be hard to work out the causes of health outcomes because ill-health can influence risk factors and risk factors tend to influence each other. To work out whether particular interventions influence health outcomes, scientists will ideally conduct a so-called randomized controlled trial, where some randomly-chosen participants are given an intervention that modifies the risk factor and others are not. But this type of experiment can be expensive or impractical to conduct.Alternatively , scientists can also use genetics to mimic a randomized controlled trial. This technique – known as Mendelian randomization – is possible for two reasons. First, because it is essentially random whether a person has one version of a gene or another. Second, because our genes influence different risk factors. For example, people with one version of a gene might be more likely to drink alcohol than people with another version. Researchers can compare people with different versions of the gene to infer what effect alcohol drinking has on their health.Every day, new studies investigate the role of genetic variants in human health, which scientists can draw on for research using Mendelian randomization. But until now, complete results from these studies have not been organized in one place. At the same time, statistical methods for Mendelian randomization are continually being developed and improved. To take advantage of these advances, Hemani, Zheng, Elsworth et al. produced a computer programme and online platform called “MR-Base”, combining up-to-date genetic data with the latest statistical methods.MR-Base automates the process of Mendelian randomization, making research much faster: analyses that previously could have taken months can now be done in minutes. It also makes studies more reliable, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring scientists use the latest methods. MR-Base contains over 11 billion associations between people’s genes and health-related outcomes. This will allow researchers to investigate many potential causes of poor health. As new statistical methods and new findings from genetic studies are added to MR-Base, its value to researchers will grow.;,citation_author=Gibran Hemani;,citation_author=Jie Zheng;,citation_author=Benjamin Elsworth;,citation_author=Kaitlin H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preparing to react in the absence of uncertainty: I. New perspectives on simple reaction time;,citation_abstract=Almost from the inception of psychological enquiry into reaction time (RT), a broad distinction has been drawn between two types of process-serving performance in RT tasks, namely, the on-line processes initiated by the arrival of the imperative signal and preparatory processes, which precede the imperative signal and may contribute to performance efficiency. Restriction of attention to on-line processing fosters the conclusion that the processes serving simple RT are no more than a subset of those involved in choice reactions. If, however, latencies can be reduced by specific preparation then the certitudes of the simple reaction task may invest it with distinctive properties. The possibility of preparation being sensory as well as motor needs to be considered. Until recently, attempts to study preparedness have failed to make controlled comparisons across simple and choice RT. However, recent work has shown that simple reactions have distinctive characteristics that set them apart from minimal choice reactions. The optimization of simple RT seems to depend upon attention-demanding processes which are probably preparatory in nature. When attention has to be shared with a concurrent task, much of the normal advantage of the simple reaction is lost. Neuropsychological studies suggest that patients may be found with abnormally extended simple RT but spared choice reactions. In these patients, the simple reactions are prolonged relative to those of controls but less vulnerable to imposition of a secondary task. Evidence is beginning to accrue to the effect that some distinctive processing features of simple reactions may be mediated by activity in the frontal lobes.;,citation_author=Leslie Henderson;,citation_author=Winand H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cohort profile: Wisconsin longitudinal study (WLS);,citation_abstract=The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) is a longitudinal study of men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957 and one of their randomly selected siblings. Wisconsin is located in the upper midwest of the United States and had a population of approximately 14 000 000 in 1957, making it the 14th most populous state at that time. Data spanning almost 60 years allow researchers to link family background, adolescent characteristics, educational experiences, employment experiences, income, wealth, family formation and social and religious engagement to midlife and late-life physical health, mental health, psychological well-being, cognition, end of life planning and mortality. The WLS is one of the few longitudinal data sets that include an administrative measure of cognition from childhood. Further, recently collected saliva samples allow researchers to explore the inter-relationships among genes, behaviours and environment, including genetic determinants of behaviours (e.g. educational attainment); the interactions between genes and environment; and how these interactions predict behaviours. Most panel members were born in 1939, and the sample is broadly representative of White, non-Hispanic American men and women who have completed at least a high school education. Siblings cover several adjoining cohorts: they were born primarily between 1930 and 1948. At each interview, about two-thirds of the sample lived in Wisconsin, and about one-third lived elsewhere in the United States or abroad.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):  Controversy, Developmental Mechanisms, and Multiple Levels of Analysis;,citation_abstract=Controversy abounds regarding the symptom dimensions of attention problems, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, developmentally extreme and impairing levels of which compose the diagnostic category of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I highlight causal factors, underlying mechanisms, developmental trajectories, and female manifestations of ADHD, integrating the psychobiological underpinnings of this syndrome with contextual factors related to its clinical presentation, impairments, and soaring increases in diagnosed prevalence. Indeed, despite strong heritability, ADHD is expressed via transactional patterns of influence linked to family- , school-, peer-, neighborhood-, and policy-related factors. Moreover, intervention strategies must take into account both pharmacologic and behavioral modalities if the goal is to enhance competencies, rather than symptom reduction per se. A comprehensive understanding of ADHD mandates multiple levels of analysis—spanning genes, neurotransmission, brain pathways, individual skill levels, family socialization, peer relationships, and educational and cultural forces—which must be integrated and synthesized to surpass reductionist accounts, reduce stigma, and maximize the impact of prevention- and intervention-related efforts.;,citation_author=Stephen P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional dysregulation is a primary symptom in adult  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD);,citation_abstract=Background: Clinical observations suggest that adults have more diverse deficits than children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These seem to entail difficulties with emotionality, self-concept and emotion regulation in particular, along with the cardinal symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity for adult patients. Here, we probed a model that explicitly distinguished positive and negative affect, problems with self-concept and emotion regulation skills as distinct but correlating factors with the symptom domains of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Methods: Participants were 213 newly diagnosed adults with ADHD (62.9% male, mean age 33.5 years). Symptoms were assessed via self-report on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales, a modified version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale and the Emotion Regulation Skill Questionnaire. A confirmatory factor analysis with the R package lavaan, using a robust Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLR) for non-normal data, was conducted to test our new non-hierarchical 7-factor model. Results: All calculated model-fit statistics revealed good model-fit (χ2/df ratio = 2.03, robust RMSEA = .07). The SRMR in our model reached .089, indicating an acceptable model fit. Factor loadings on the postulated factors had salient loadings ≥ .31 except for one item on the hyperactivity factor. Latent factor associations were especially salient between emotional dysregulation and problems with self-concept, and also partially with impulsivity/emotional lability. Limitations: The three models of ADHD and emotion regulation as suggested by Shaw et al. (2014) could not be disentangled in this study, though the overall results support the model with shared neurocognitive deficits. Further, we did not separately analyze ADHD with or without comorbid disorders. As our sample of clinical cases with ADHD is highly comorbid (47.9 %), other disorders than ADHD might account for the emotion regulation deficits, though a sensitivity analysis revealed no such differences. Conclusions: Our model adequately characterizes the relations between and among clinically and therapeutically relevant symptoms in adult ADHD, thus potentially informing future therapeutic interventions by targeting the successful and flexible use of adaptive emotion regulation skills.;,citation_author=Oliver Hirsch;,citation_author=MiraLynn Chavanon;,citation_author=Elke Riechmann;,citation_author=Hanna Christiansen;,citation_publication_date=2018-05;,citation_cover_date=2018-05;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165032717323662;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jad.2018.02.007;,citation_issn=01650327;,citation_volume=232;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Affective Disorders;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=More symmetrical children have faster and more consistent choice reaction times;,citation_abstract=Greater cognitive ability in childhood is associated with increased longevity, and speedier reaction time (RT) might account for much of this linkage. Greater bodily symmetry is linked to both higher cognitive test scores and faster RTs. It is possible, then, that differences in bodily system integrity indexed by symmetry may underlie the associations of RT and intelligence with increased longevity. However, RT and symmetry have seldom been examined in the same study, and never in children. Here, in 2 large samples aged 4 to 15 (combined n = 856), we found that more symmetrical children had significantly faster mean choice RT and less variability in RT. These associations of faster and less variable RT with greater symmetry early in life raise the possibility that the determinants of longevity in part originate in processes influencing bodily system integrity early in the life-course.;,citation_author=David Hope;,citation_author=Timothy C.

This system has the potential to enhance the clinical utility of the diagnostic nosology by providing a means for the dimensional assessment of individuals with psychopathology. However, there is limited research on the associations of DSM-5 traits with common mental disorders and related clinical phenomena as measured by currently popular assessment instruments. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the convergence of the DSM-5 trait system with a well-validated broadband clinical instrument, the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Bivariate correlations were examined and factor analytic methods were used to examine the degree to which the DSM-5 traits and PAI capture common variance in personality and mental health. In a student sample (N = 1,001), we found broad convergence between the DSM-5 traits and PAI, which could be organized effectively using five factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Verbal working memory impairments in individuals with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives: Findings from the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia;,citation_abstract=Working memory (WM) impairment is a promising candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia that could facilitate the identification of susceptibility genes for this disorder. The validity of this putative endophenotype was assessed by determining whether 149 probands with schizophrenia and 337 of their first-degree relatives demonstrated WM impairment as compared to 190 unaffected community comparison subjects. Subjects were participants in the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS) project, a seven-site research network that was established to investigate the genetic architecture of endophenotypes for schizophrenia. Participants received comprehensive clinical assessments and completed two verbal WM tasks, one requiring transient on-line storage and another requiring maintenance plus complex manipulation of information by reordering the stimuli. Schizophrenia probands performed worse than the other groups on both tasks, with larger deficits found for the more challenging reordering WM task. The probands’ relatives performed more poorly than community comparison subjects on both tasks, but the difference was significant only for the more challenging maintenance plus complex manipulation WM task. This WM impairment was not attributable to diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, mood disorders, or substance use disorders in the relatives. In conjunction with evidence that WM abilities are substantially heritable, the current results support the validity and usefulness of verbal WM impairments in manipulation of information as endophenotypes for schizophrenia in large-scale genetic linkage and association studies.;,citation_author=William P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Replication study of candidate genes for cognitive abilities: The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936;,citation_abstract=As the proportion of older people in societies has increased, research into the determinants of cognitive ageing has risen in importance. Genetic influences account for over 50% of the variance in adult cognitive abilities. Previous studies on cognition and illnesses with cognitive impairments have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes that might influence cognition or age-related cognitive change. This study investigated 10 candidate genes in over 1000 Scots: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936). These participants were tested on general cognitive ability (Scottish Mental Survey 1947) at age 11. At mean age 70, they completed the same general cognitive ability test and a battery of diverse cognitive tests. Nineteen SNPs in 10 genes previously associated with cognition, Alzheimer’s disease or autism were genotyped in 1063 individuals. The genes include BDNF, COMT, DISC1, KL, NCSTN, PPP1R1B, PRNP, SHANK3, SORL1 and WRN. Linear regression analysis investigated the additive effect of each SNP on the cognitive variables, covarying for gender and age. Childhood cognitive ability was also included as a covariate to identify associations specifically with cognitive ageing. Certain SNPs reached the conventional significance threshold for association with cognitive traits or cognitive ageing in LBC1936 (P \textless 0.05). No SNPs reached the Bonferroni-level of significance (all P \textgreater 0.0015). Of the 10 genes, we discuss that COMT, KL, PRNP, PPP1R1B, SORL1 and WRN especially merit further attention for association with cognitive ability and/or age-related cognitive change.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is poor working memory a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology?;,citation_abstract=© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. In contrast to historical conceptualizations that framed psychological disorders as distinct, categorical conditions, it is now widely understood that co- and multi-morbidities between disorders are extensive. As a result, there has been a call to better understand the dimensional liabilities that are common to and influence the development of multiple psychopathologies, as supported and exemplified by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. We use a latent variable SEM approach to examine the degree to which working memory deficits represent a cognitive liability associated with the development of common and discrete dimensions of psychopathology. In a sample of 415 community recruited children aged 8–12 (n = 170 girls), we fit a bi-factor model to parent reports of behavior from the DISC-4 and BASC-2, and included a latent working memory factor as a predictor of the internalizing, externalizing, and general “p-factor.” We found that both the general “p-factor” and externalizing (but not internalizing) latent factor were significantly associated with working memory. When a bi-factor model of externalizing symptomology was fit to further explore this relationship, working memory was only correlated with the general externalizing dimension; correlation with specific inattention, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional factors did not survive once the general externalizing dimension was taken into consideration. These findings held regardless of the sex of the child. Our results suggest that working memory deficits represent both a common cognitive liability for mental health disorders, and a specific liability for externalizing disorders.;,citation_author=Cynthia Huang-Pollock;,citation_author=Zvi Shapiro;,citation_author=Hilary Galloway-Long;,citation_author=Alex Weigard;,citation_publication_date=2017-11;,citation_cover_date=2017-11;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10802-016-0219-8;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10802-016-0219-8;,citation_isbn=1080201602;,citation_issn=00910627;,citation_volume=45;,citation_journal_title=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distinct cortical networks activated by auditory attention and working memory load;,citation_abstract=Auditory attention and working memory (WM) allow for selection and maintenance of relevant sound information in our minds, respectively, thus underlying goal-directed functioning in everyday acoustic environments. It is still unclear whether these two closely coupled functions are based on a common neural circuit, or whether they involve genuinely distinct subfunctions with separate neuronal substrates. In a full factorial functional MRI (fMRI) design, we independently manipulated the levels of auditory-verbal WM load and attentional interference using modified Auditory Continuous Performance Tests. Although many frontoparietal regions were jointly activated by increases of WM load and interference, there was a double dissociation between prefrontal cortex (PFC) subareas associated selectively with either auditory attention or WM. Specifically, anterior dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and the right anterior insula were selectively activated by increasing WM load, whereas subregions of middle lateral PFC and inferior frontal cortex (IFC) were associated with interference only. Meanwhile, a superadditive interaction between interference and load was detected in left medial superior frontal cortex, suggesting that in this area, activations are not only overlapping, but reflect a common resource pool recruited by increased attentional and WM demands. Indices of WM-specific suppression of anterolateral non-primary auditory cortices (AC) and attention-specific suppression of primary AC were also found, possibly reflecting suppression/interruption of sound-object processing of irrelevant stimuli during continuous task performance. Our results suggest a double dissociation between auditory attention and working memory in subregions of anterior DLPFC vs. middle lateral PFC/IFC in humans, respectively, in the context of substantially overlapping circuits. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Samantha Huang;,citation_author=Larry J.

Using a 2?index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)?based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker?Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen’s (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald’s Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML?based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true?population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2?index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true?population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML?based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true?population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.;,citation_author=Li‐tze Hu;,citation_author=Peter M Bentler;,citation_publication_date=1999-01;,citation_cover_date=1999-01;,citation_year=1999;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10705519909540118

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is less really more: Does a prefrontal efficiency genotype actually confer better performance when working memory becomes difficult?;,citation_abstract=Perhaps the most widely studied effect to emerge from the combination of neuroimaging and human genetics is the association of the COMT-Val108/158Met polymorphism with prefrontal activity during working memory. COMT-Val is a putative risk factor in schizophrenia, which is characterized by disordered prefrontal function. Work in healthy populations has sought to characterize mechanisms by which the valine (Val) allele may lead to disadvantaged prefrontal cognition. Lower activity in methionine (Met) carriers has been interpreted as advantageous neural efficiency. Notably, however, studies reporting COMT effects on neural efficiency have generally not reported working memory performance effects. Those studies have employed relatively low/easy working memory loads. Higher loads are known to elicit individual differences in working memory performance that are not visible at lower loads. If COMT-Met confers greater neural efficiency when working memory is easy, a reasonable prediction is that Met carriers will be better able to cope with increasing demand for neural resources when working memory becomes difficult. To our knowledge, this prediction has thus far gone untested. Here, we tested performance on three working memory tasks. Performance on each task was measured at multiple levels of load/difficulty, including loads more demanding than those used in prior studies. We found no genotype-by-load interactions or main effects of COMT genotype on accuracy or reaction time. Indeed, even testing for performance differences at each load of each task failed to find a single significant effect of COMT genotype. Thus, even if COMT genotype has the effects on prefrontal efficiency that prior work has suggested, such effects may not directly impact high-load working memory ability. The present findings accord with previous evidence that behavioral effects of COMT are small or nonexistent and, more broadly, with a growing consensus that substantial effects on phenotype will not emerge from candidate gene studies.;,citation_author=Jessica L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic association study of childhood aggression across raters, instruments, and age;,citation_abstract=Childhood aggressive behavior (AGG) has a substantial heritability of around 50%. Here we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of childhood AGG, in which all phenotype measures across childhood ages from multiple assessors were included. We analyzed phenotype assessments for a total of 328 935 observations from 87 485 children aged between 1.5 and 18 years, while accounting for sample overlap. We also meta-analyzed within subsets of the data, i.e., within rater, instrument and age. SNP-heritability for the overall meta-analysis (AGGoverall) was 3.31% (SE = 0.0038). We found no genome-wide significant SNPs for AGGoverall. The gene-based analysis returned three significant genes: ST3GAL3 (P = 1.6E–06), PCDH7 (P = 2.0E–06), and IPO13 (P  = 2.5E–06). All three genes have previously been associated with educational traits. Polygenic scores based on our GWAMA significantly predicted aggression in a holdout sample of children (variance explained = 0.44%) and in retrospectively assessed childhood aggression (variance explained = 0.20%). Genetic correlations (rg) among rater-specific assessment of AGG ranged from rg = 0.46 between self- and teacher-assessment to rg =  0.81 between mother- and teacher-assessment. We obtained moderate-to-strong rgs with selected phenotypes from multiple domains, but hardly with any of the classical biomarkers thought to be associated with AGG. Significant genetic correlations were observed with most psychiatric and psychological traits (range $$ \left| {r_g} \right|$$: 0.19–1.00) , except for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Aggression had a negative genetic correlation (rg = ~−0.5) with cognitive traits and age at first birth. Aggression was strongly genetically correlated with smoking phenotypes (range $$ \left| {r_g} \right|$$: 0.46–0.60). The genetic correlations between aggression and psychiatric disorders were weaker for teacher-reported AGG than for mother- and self-reported AGG.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personality Disorders in Adult Female Child Sexual Abuse Survivors: Dimensions of Personality Pathology and  Characteristics of Abuse;,citation_abstract=The relationship between child sexual abuse (CSA) and later personality disorders (PDs) has been established in numerous studies. However, there are still a number of uncertainties about the specifics of this association. This study further explored the child sexual abuse survivors’ (CSASs) vulnerability to PDs by introducing the variable of personality organization (PO) and dimensions of personality pathology as conceptualized by Kernberg, and by including additional variables of CSA characteristics. It was hypothesized that in the CSA group, the occurrence of borderline personality organization (BPO) would be significantly higher than in the non-CSA group and that characteristics of abuse associated with its higher severity would prevail in individuals with BPO. The study group consisted of 329 women who completed measures of PO and experiences of CSA. The results were consistent with formulated hypotheses. Significantly more CSASs than those who did not experience CSA were characterized by close to BPO (cBPO). Moreover, CSASs group differed from the group without the CSA experience with regard to all BPO dimensions. The biggest difference between the CSA and the control group concerned the dimension referring to the difficulties in creating close, intimate relationships. With regard to CSA features, women characterized by cBPO, in contrast to those characterized by neurotic personality organization (NPO), significantly more often reported having experienced CSA more than once, involving physical contact, from more than one offender and from the offender they previously known. The findings of the study support the idea that the optimal treatment approach for CSASs should address both the personality structure and the specificity of the impact of CSA along with its characteristics.;,citation_author=Agnieszka Izdebska;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260520903136;,citation_issue=23-24;,citation_doi=10.1177/0886260520903136;,citation_issn=0886-2605, 1552-6518;,citation_volume=36;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J Interpers Violence;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Short- and long-term benefits of cognitive training;,citation_abstract=Does cognitive training work? There are numerous commercial training interventions claiming to improve general mental capacity; however, the scientific evidence for such claims is sparse. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence that certain cognitive interventions are effective. Here we provide evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive (often called &amp;amp;amp;quot;brain&amp;quot;) training. However , we demonstrate that there are important individual differences that determine training and transfer. We trained elementary and middle school children by means of a videogame-like working memory task. We found that only children who considerably improved on the training task showed a performance increase on untrained fluid intelligence tasks. This improvement was larger than the improvement of a control group who trained on a knowledge-based task that did not engage working memory; further, this differential pattern remained intact even after a 3-mo hiatus from training. We conclude that cognitive training can be effective and long-lasting, but that there are limiting factors that must be considered to evaluate the effects of this training, one of which is individual differences in training performance. We propose that future research should not investigate whether cognitive training works, but rather should determine what training regimens and what training conditions result in the best transfer effects, investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms, and finally, investigate for whom cognitive training is most useful.;,citation_author=Susanne M.

Moreover, multiple correlated phenotypes further complicate such analyses. To resolve this complexity, we present an analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM). Unlike current methods that focus only on identifying direct associations between diseases and genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), our method introduces the effects of intermediate phenotypes, which are related phenotypes distinct from the target, into the systematic genetic study of diseases. Moreover, we consider multiple diseases simultaneously in a single model. The procedure can be summarized in four steps: 1) selection of informative SNPs, 2) extraction of latent variables from the selected SNPs, 3) investigation of the relationships among intermediate phenotypes and diseases, and 4) construction of an SEM. As a result, a quantitative map can be drawn that simultaneously shows the relationship among multiple SNPs, phenotypes, and diseases. In this study, we considered two correlated diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which are known to have a substantial overlap in their disease mechanism and have significant public health implications. As intermediate phenotypes for these diseases, we considered three obesity-related phenotypes—subscapular skin fold thickness, body mass index, and waist circumference—as traits representing subcutaneous adiposity, overall adiposity, and abdominal adiposity, respectively. Using GWAS data collected from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project, we applied the proposed SEM process. Among 327,872 SNPs, 24 informative SNPs were selected in the first step (p \textless1.0E-05). Ten latent variables were generated in step 2. After an exploratory analysis, we established a path diagram among phenotypes and diseases in step 3. Finally, in step 4, we produced a quantitative map with paths moving from specific SNPs to hypertension through intermediate phenotypes and T2D. The resulting model had high goodness-of fit measures (χ ^2= 536.52, NFI=0.997, CFI=0.998).;,citation_author=Saebom Jeon;,citation_author=Ji-yeon Shin;,citation_author=Jaeyong Yee;,citation_author=Taesung Park;,citation_author=Mira Park;,citation_editor=Joseph Devaney;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/631853v1

We aimed to examine the mediator role of difficulties in emotion regulation on the relationship between RF and BPD symptoms in a non-clinical adolescent sample. The sample was composed of 546 Turkish adolescents with a mean age of 16.18 ( SD = 1.67). Of the sample, 62.5% were adolescent girls and 37.5% of boys. In the present cross-sectional research, volunteer adolescents along with parental permission filled out Socio-Demographics Form, Reflective Functioning Questionnaire, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale , and Borderline Personality Inventory on paper during counseling sessions at schools. Process macro was used to conduct mediation analyses. Compromised RF was related to an increase in adolescent borderline personality symptoms, both directly and indirectly via difficulties in emotion regulation. In this non-clinical adolescent sample, a lower degree of certainty, as well as a higher degree of uncertainty about the mental states, were related to a propensity to emotion dysregulation, specifically experiencing emotions less clearly, approaching emotions impulsively, and facing emotions without a modulation strategy. These associations were in turn related to an increase in borderline personality symptoms. The present research results suggest RF and emotion regulation problems as one field of early intervention for adolescents with BPD symptoms.;,citation_author=Yasemin Kahya;,citation_author=Koret Munguldar;,citation_publication_date=2022-01-20;,citation_cover_date=2022-01-20;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00332941211061072;,citation_doi=10.1177/00332941211061072;,citation_issn=0033-2941, 1558-691X;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychol Rep;">

A potential distinguishing factor between benign PLEs versus PLEs that are clinically relevant is whether PLEs are distressing and/or persistent. The current study used three waves of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development℠ (ABCD) study PLEs assessments to examine the extent to which persistent and/or distressing PLEs were associated with relevant baseline risk factors (e.g., cognition) and functioning/mental health service utilization domains. Four groups varying in PLE persistence and distress endorsement were created based on all available data in ABCD Release 3.0, with group membership not contingent on complete data: persistent distressing PLEs (n = 272), transient distressing PLEs (n = 298), persistent non-distressing PLEs (n = 221), and transient non-distressing PLEs (n = 536) groups. Using hierarchical linear models, results indicated youth with distressing PLEs, whether transient or persistent, showed delayed developmental milestones (β  = 0.074, 95%CI:0.013,0.134) and altered structural MRI metrics (β = −0.0525, 95%CI:−0.100,−0.005). Importantly, distress interacted with PLEs persistence for the domains of functioning/mental health service utilization (β = 0.079, 95% CI:0.016,0.141), other reported psychopathology (β = 0.101, 95% CI:0.030,0.170), cognition (β = −0.052, 95%CI:0.−0.099,−0.002), and environmental adversity (β = 0.045, 95%CI:0.003,0.0.86; although no family history effects), with the interaction characterized by greatest impairment in the persistent distressing PLEs group. These results have implications for disentangling the importance of distress and persistence for PLEs with regards to impairments, including functional, pathophysiological, and environmental outcomes. These novel longitudinal data underscore that it is often only in the context of distress that persistent PLEs were related to impairments.;,citation_author=Nicole R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A multimodal assessment of the genetic control over working memory.;,citation_abstract=Working memory performance is significantly influenced by genetic factors. Here, we assessed genetic contributions to both working memory performance and neuroimaging measures focused on the network of brain regions associated with working memory by using a sample of 467 human participants from extended families. Imaging measures included diffusion tensor imaging indices in major white matter tracts thought to be associated with working memory and structural magnetic resonance imaging measures of frontal and parietal gray matter density. Analyses directly addressed whether working memory performance and neural structural integrity are influenced by common genetic factors (e.g., pleiotropy). While all cognitive measures, gray matter regions, and white matter tracts assessed were heritable, only performance on a spatial delayed response task and integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (a primary fronto-parietal connection) shared genetic factors. As working memory may be a core component of other higher level processes, such as general intelligence, this finding has implications for the heritability of complex cognitive functions, as well as for our understanding of the transmission of cognitive deficits in mental and neurological disorders.;,citation_author=Katherine H Karlsgodt;,citation_author=Peter Kochunov;,citation_author=Anderson M Winkler;,citation_author=Angela R Laird;,citation_author=Laura Almasy;,citation_author=Ravindranath Duggirala;,citation_author=Rene L Olvera;,citation_author=Peter T Fox;,citation_author=John Blangero;,citation_author=David C Glahn;,citation_publication_date=2010-06;,citation_cover_date=2010-06;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=

The loci were enriched for genes expressed in the brain and related to nervous system development. A polygenic score constructed from our results predicts a range of behavioral and medical outcomes that were not part of genome-wide analyses, including traits that until now lacked well-performing polygenic scores, such as opioid use disorder, suicide, HIV infections, criminal convictions and unemployment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Child-based treatment of oppositional defiant disorder: Mediating effects on parental depression, anxiety and stress;,citation_abstract=Previous research has shown that child-oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorders (CD) are associated with parental symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or stress, probably in a bidirectional relationship with mutual influences. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that in child-centered treatment, a decrease in child-oppositional behavior problems constitutes (at least in part) a mechanism of change for a subsequent reduction in parental psychopathology. The aim of the present study (Clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT01406067) was to examine whether the reduction in ODD symptoms due to child-based cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) led to a reduction in parental depression, anxiety and stress. Eighty-one boys (age 6–12&nbsp;years) with a diagnosis of ODD/CD were randomized either to a cognitive behavioral intervention group or an educational play group (acting as control group). Mediation analyses were conducted using path analysis. The stronger reduction in child ODD symptoms in the CBT group compared to the control group led to a decrease in parental depression and stress, as indicated by significant indirect effects (ab = 0.07 and ab = 0.08, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05). The proposed model for mechanisms of change was, therefore, confirmed for two of the three outcome parameters. Parental psychopathology and stress can be modified by child-centered CBT. The preceding reduction in ODD symptoms acts as a mediator for at least some of the changes in parental depression and stress. However, due to some limitations of the study, other possible explanations for the results found cannot be completely ruled out and are, therefore, discussed.;,citation_author=Josepha Katzmann;,citation_author=Manfred Döpfner;,citation_author=Anja Görtz-Dorten;,citation_publication_date=2018-09-01;,citation_cover_date=2018-09-01;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-018-1181-5;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00787-018-1181-5;,citation_issn=1435-165X;,citation_volume=27;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Polygenic risk for schizophrenia associated with working memory-related prefrontal brain activation in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls;,citation_abstract=Schizophrenia is a highly heritable and polygenic disease, and identified common genetic variants have shown weak individual effects. Many studies have reported altered working memory (WM)-related brain activation in schizophrenia, preferentially in the frontal lobe. Such differences in brain activations could reflect inherited alterations possibly involved in the disease etiology, or rather secondary disease-related mechanisms. The use of polygenic risk scores (PGRS) based on a large number of risk polymorphisms with small effects is a valuable approach to examine the effect of cumulative genetic risk on brain functioning. This study examined the impact of cumulative genetic risk for schizophrenia on WM-related brain activations, assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each participant (63 schizophrenia patients and 118 healthy controls), we calculated a PGRS for schizophrenia based on 18 862 single-nucleotide polymorphism in a large multicenter genome-wide association study including 9146 schizophrenia patients and 12 111 controls, performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. As expected, the PGRS was significantly higher in patients compared with healthy controls. Further, the PGRS was related to differences in frontal lobe brain activation between high and low WM demand. Specifically, even in absence of main effects of diagnosis, increased PGRS was associated with decreased activation difference in the right middle-superior prefrontal cortex (BA 10/11) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45). This effect was seen in both cases and controls, and was not influenced by sex, age, or task performance. The findings support the notion of dysregulation of frontal lobe functioning as an inherited vulnerability factor in schizophrenia.;,citation_author=Karolina Kauppi;,citation_author=Lars T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Corticospinal excitability is reduced in a simple reaction time task requiring complex timing;,citation_abstract=Increasing the complexity of a movement has been shown to result in longer simple reaction time (RT), which has been attributed to sequencing or timing requirements following the go-signal. However, RT differences may also be due to differences in corticospinal excitability (CE) as previous studies have found an enhanced excitatory state of corticospinal neurons in complex tasks. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used in the present study to probe the excitability of the motor pathway during the simple RT interval for single (simple) versus multiple (complex) key press responses. Premotor RT data indicated that participants responded significantly (p¡.001) faster in the simple task compared to the complex task, confirming response complexity was manipulated appropriately. Analysis of the CE data indicated that motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes increased with time following the go-signal in both conditions and that MEP amplitudes in the simple task were significantly larger than those in the complex task when evoked within 75 ms of movement onset (p=.009). These findings suggest that the rate of increase for initiation-related neural activation is reduced for complex as compared to simple movements, which may partially explain differences in RT.;,citation_author=Michael Kennefick;,citation_author=Dana Maslovat;,citation_author=Romeo Chua;,citation_author=Anthony N.

A reliable estimate of certainty is essential for prediction, learning from mistakes, and planning subsequent actions when outcomes are not immediate. It is generally thought that certainty is informed by a neural representation of evidence at the time of a decision. Here we show that certainty is also informed by the time taken to form the decision. Human subjects reported simultaneously their choice and confidence about the direction of a noisy display of moving dots. Certainty was inversely correlated with reaction times and directly correlated with motion strength. Moreover, these correlations were preserved even for error responses, a finding that contradicts existing explanations of certainty based on signal detection theory. We also contrived a stimulus manipulation that led to longer decision times without affecting choice accuracy, thus demonstrating that deliberation time itself informs the estimate of certainty. We suggest that elapsed decision time informs certainty because it serves as a proxy for task difficulty.;,citation_author=Roozbeh Kiani;,citation_author=Leah Corthell;,citation_author=Michael N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Attention- versus significance-driven memory formation: Taxonomy, neural substrates, and meta-analyses;,citation_abstract=Functional neuroimaging data on episodic memory formation have expanded rapidly over the last 30 years, which raises the need for an integrative framework. This study proposes a taxonomy of episodic memory for­ mation to address this need. At the broadest level, the taxonomy distinguishes between attention-driven vs. significance-driven memory formation. The three subtypes of attention-driven memory formation are selection-, fluctuation-, and level-related. The three subtypes of significance-driven memory formation are novelty-, emotion-, and reward-related. Meta-analytic data indicated that attention-driven memory formation affects the functioning of the extra-medial temporal lobe more strongly than the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions. In contrast, significance-driven memory formation affects the functioning of the MTL more strongly than the extraMTL regions. This study proposed a model in which attention has a stronger impact on the formation of neocortical traces than hippocampus/MTL traces, whereas significance has a stronger impact on the formation of hippocampus/MTL traces than neocortical traces. Overall, the taxonomy and model provide an integrative framework in which to place diverse encoding-related findings into a proper perspective.;,citation_author=Hongkeun Kim;,citation_publication_date=2022-07;,citation_cover_date=2022-07;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149763422001749;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104685;,citation_issn=01497634;,citation_volume=138;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Neuroscience &amp;amp;amp; Biobehavioral Reviews;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Training and plasticity of working memory;,citation_abstract=Working memory (WM) capacity predicts performance in a wide range of cognitive tasks. Although WM capacity has been viewed as a constant trait, recent studies suggest that it can be improved by adaptive and extended training. This training is associated with changes in brain activity in frontal and parietal cortex and basal ganglia, as well as changes in dopamine receptor density. Transfer of the training effects to non-trained WM tasks is consistent with the notion of training-induced plasticity in a common neural network for WM. The observed training effects suggest that WM training could be used as a remediating intervention for individuals for whom low WM capacity is a limiting factor for academic performance or in everyday life. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Torkel Klingberg;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.05.002;,citation_issn=13646613;,citation_book_title=Trends Cogn.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genome-wide significant localization for working and spatial memory: Identifying genes for psychosis using models of cognition;,citation_abstract=It is well established that risk for developing psychosis is largely mediated by the influence of genes, but identifying precisely which genes underlie that risk has been problematic. Focusing on endophenotypes, rather than illness risk, is one solution to this problem. Impaired cognition is a well-established endophenotype of psychosis. Here we aimed to characterize the genetic architecture of cognition using phenotypically detailed models as opposed to relying on general IQ or individual neuropsychological measures. In so doing we hoped to identify genes that mediate cognitive ability, which might also contribute to psychosis risk. Hierarchical factor models of genetically clustered cognitive traits were subjected to linkage analysis followed by QTL region-specific association analyses in a sample of 1,269 Mexican American individuals from extended pedigrees. We identified four genome wide significant QTLs, two for working and two for spatial memory, and a number of plausible and interesting candidate genes. The creation of detailed models of cognition seemingly enhanced the power to detect genetic effects on cognition and provided a number of possible candidate genes for psychosis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals , Inc.;,citation_author=Emma E.

Method: Participants aged 12–16 years were enrolled in a prospective, open-label trial consisting of 3 weeks of OROS methylphenidate monotherapy titrated to 54 mg/day, followed by 9 weeks of combination treatment with quetiapine and methylphenidate. Twenty-four out of thirty participants failed to meet criteria for significant improvement (Clinical Global Improvement-Severity [CGI-S] and Rating of Aggression Against People and Property [RAAPP] scale scores of 1 or 2 and ADHD-Rating Scale: Investigator Administered and Scored [ADHD-RS-I] score less than 50% of baseline score) with methylphenidate treatment alone and received combined treatment. Results: Investigator and parent ratings of ADHD symptoms, aggression, and global functioning improved significantly during both methylphenidate monotherapy treatment and during combined methylphenidate–quetiapine treatment. At the conclusion of combined treatment, 42% of the sample met all criteria for clinically significant improvement and 79% showed minimal aggression. Mild and transient sedation was reported by about half the cases. Weight loss (0.9 kg) during methylphenidate treatment was offset by weight gain (1.2 kg) during combination treatment. Conclusion: Quetiapine addition to methylphenidate was effective in reducing ADHD and aggression in individuals who did not respond sufficiently (based on CGI-S, RAAPP, and ADHD-RS-I criteria for significant improvement) to OROS methylphenidate alone at a 54-mg/day dose.;,citation_author=William G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reasoning ability is (little more than) working-memory capacity⁈;,citation_abstract=This paper is concerned with the relationship between two central constructs-reasoning ability and working-memory capacity-which arise from two distinct bodies of literature on individual differences in cognition, the psychometric and the information-processing, respectively. In four separate studies (N = 723, 412, 415, and 594), we assessed reasoning ability using various tests from the psychometric literature, and working-memory capacity using tests constructed according to Baddeley’s (1986) definition of working memory. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded consistently high estimates of the correlation between working-memory capacity and reasoning ability factors (r = .80 to .90). We also found differentiation between the two factors: Reasoning correlated comparatively highly with general knowledge; working-memory capacity correlated comparatively highly with processing speed. Inspection of residuals from model fitting suggested the existence of a verbal versus quantitative content factor. We discuss the implications of our results for what they tell us about the nature of reasoning, and the nature of working memory. © 1990 Ablex Publishing Corporation.;,citation_author=Patrick C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The development of antisocial behavior: An integrative causal model;,citation_abstract=This annotation presents an integrative model of the origins and development of antisocial behavior during childhood and adolescence. Like all theoretical models, it both summarizes what is known and states hypotheses that go beyond the current data. The model focuses on enduring propensities to antisocial behavior but also places antisocial propensity within a developmental perspective. The authors posit that changing manifestations of problem behavior over the course of the development result from successive transactions of the growing child with changing social environments. As such, roles for person variables, developmental variables, and environmental variables are specified, as are interactions among these classes of variables. The age of onset of antisocial behavior is a key element of the present model as the levels of influence from the multiple causal factors vary with the age of onset of antisocial behavior. Because much more is known about antisocial behavior in boys than girls, the present model may be applicable only to boys. There may be important gender differences that will require different models for girls and boys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Benjamin B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Patterns of Heterotypic Continuity Associated With the  Cross-Sectional Correlational Structure of Prevalent Mental Disorders in Adults;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE To test predictions derived from a hierarchical-dimensional model of psychopathology that (1) heterotypic continuity is widespread, even controlling for homotypic continuity, and that (2) the relative magnitudes of heterotypic continuities recapitulate the relative magnitudes of cross-sectional correlations among diagnoses at baseline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Ten prevalent diagnoses were assessed in the same person twice (ie, in 2 waves separated by 3 years). We used a representative sample of adults in the United States (ie, 28 958 participants 18-64 years of age in the National Epidemiologic Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions who were assessed in both waves). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnoses from reliable and valid structured interviews. RESULTS Adjusting for sex and age, we found that bivariate associations of all pairs of diagnoses from wave 1 to wave 2 exceeded chance levels (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .05) for all homotypic (median tetrachoric correlation of ρ = 0.54 [range, 0.41-0.79]) and for nearly all heterotypic continuities (median tetrachoric correlation of ρ = 0.28 [range, 0.07-0.50]). Significant heterotypic continuity was widespread even when all wave 1 diagnoses (including the same diagnosis) were simultaneous predictors of each wave 2 diagnosis. The rank correlation between age- and sex-adjusted tetrachoric correlation for cross-sectional associations among wave 1 diagnoses and for heterotypic associations from wave 1 to wave 2 diagnoses was ρ = 0.86 (P $&amp;lt;$ .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For these prevalent mental disorders, heterotypic continuity was nearly universal and not an artifact of failure to control for homotypic continuity. Furthermore, the relative magnitudes of heterotypic continuity closely mirrored the relative magnitudes of cross-sectional associations among these disorders, consistent with the hypothesis that both sets of associations reflect the same factors. Mental disorders are not fixed and independent entities. Rather, each diagnosis is robustly related to other diagnoses in a correlational structure that is manifested both concurrently and in patterns of heterotypic continuity across time.;,citation_author=Benjamin B Lahey;,citation_author=David H Zald;,citation_author=Jahn K Hakes;,citation_author=Robert F Krueger;,citation_author=Paul J Rathouz;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying nootropic drug targets via large-scale cognitive GWAS and transcriptomics;,citation_abstract=Abstract Broad-based cognitive deficits are an enduring and disabling symptom for many patients with severe mental illness, and these impairments are inadequately addressed by current medications. While novel drug targets for schizophrenia and depression have emerged from recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these psychiatric disorders, GWAS of general cognitive ability can suggest potential targets for nootropic drug repurposing. Here, we (1) meta-analyze results from two recent cognitive GWAS to further enhance power for locus discovery; (2) employ several complementary transcriptomic methods to identify genes in these loci that are credibly associated with cognition; and (3) further annotate the resulting genes using multiple chemoinformatic databases to identify “druggable” targets. Using our meta-analytic data set ( N  = 373,617), we identified 241 independent cognition-associated loci (29 novel), and 76 genes were identified by 2 or more methods of gene identification. Actin and chromatin binding gene sets were identified as novel pathways that could be targeted via drug repurposing. Leveraging our transcriptomic and chemoinformatic databases, we identified 16 putative genes targeted by existing drugs potentially available for cognitive repurposing.;,citation_author=Max Lam;,citation_author=Chia-Yen Chen;,citation_author=Tian Ge;,citation_author=Yan Xia;,citation_author=David W.

Competitive pathway analysis implicated the biological processes of neurogenesis and synaptic regulation, as well as the gene targets of two pharmacologic agents: cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and LY97241, a potassium channel inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide and epigenome-wide analysis revealed that the implicated loci were enriched for genes expressed across all brain regions (most strongly in the cerebellum). Enrichment was exclusive to genes expressed in neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Finally, we report genetic correlations between cognitive ability and disparate phenotypes including psychiatric disorders, several autoimmune disorders, longevity, and maternal age at first birth. Lam et al. conduct a large-scale genome-wide association study of cognitive ability, identifying 70 associated loci. Results provide biological insights into the molecular basis of individual differences in cognitive ability, as well as their relationship to psychiatric and other health-relevant phenotypes.;,citation_author=Max Lam;,citation_author=Joey W Trampush;,citation_author=Jin Yu;,citation_author=Emma Knowles;,citation_author=Gail Davies;,citation_author=David C Liewald;,citation_author=John M Starr;,citation_author=Srdjan Djurovic;,citation_author=Ingrid Melle;,citation_author=Kjetil Sundet;,citation_author=Andrea Christoforou;,citation_author=Ivar Reinvang;,citation_author=Pamela DeRosse;,citation_author=Astri J Lundervold;,citation_author=Vidar M Steen;,citation_author=Thomas Espeseth;,citation_author=Katri Räikkönen;,citation_author=Elisabeth Widen;,citation_author=Aarno Palotie;,citation_author=Johan G.

In this brief article, we respond to each of these concerns. Using empirical data, we conclude that our MTAG results do not suffer from “inflation in the FDR [false discovery rate]”, as suggested by Hill (Twin Research and Human Genetics, Vol. 21, 2018, 84–88), and are not “more relevant to the genetic contributions to education than they are to the genetic contributions to intelligence”.;,citation_author=Max Lam;,citation_author=Joey W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pleiotropic meta-analysis of cognition, education, and schizophrenia differentiates roles of early neurodevelopmental and adult synaptic pathways.;,citation_abstract=Susceptibility to schizophrenia is inversely correlated with general cognitive ability at both the phenotypic and the genetic level. Paradoxically, a modest but consistent positive genetic correlation has been reported between schizophrenia and educational attainment, despite the strong positive genetic correlation between cognitive ability and educational attainment. Here we leverage published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia to parse biological mechanisms underlying these results. Association analysis based on subsets (ASSET), a pleiotropic meta-analytic technique, allowed jointly associated loci to be identified and characterized. Specifically, we identified subsets of variants associated in the expected (&amp;amp;amp;quot;concordant&amp;quot;) direction across all three phenotypes (i.e. , greater risk for schizophrenia, lower cognitive ability, and lower educational attainment); these were contrasted with variants that demonstrated the counterintuitive (&quot;discordant&quot;) relationship between education and schizophrenia (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia and higher educational attainment). ASSET analysis revealed 235 independent loci associated with cognitive ability, education, and/or schizophrenia at p \textless 5 × 10-8. Pleiotropic analysis successfully identified more than 100 loci that were not significant in the input GWASs. Many of these have been validated by larger, more recent single-phenotype GWASs. Leveraging the joint genetic correlations of cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia, we were able to dissociate two distinct biological mechanisms-early neurodevelopmental pathways that characterize concordant allelic variation and adulthood synaptic pruning pathways-that were linked to the paradoxical positive genetic association between education and schizophrenia. Furthermore, genetic correlation analyses revealed that these mechanisms contribute not only to the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia but also to the broader biological dimensions implicated in both general health outcomes and psychiatric illness.;,citation_author=Max Lam;,citation_author=W David Hill;,citation_author=Joey W Trampush;,citation_author=Jin Yu;,citation_author=Emma Knowles;,citation_author=Gail Davies;,citation_author=Eli Stahl;,citation_author=Laura Huckins;,citation_author=David C Liewald;,citation_author=Srdjan Djurovic;,citation_author=Ingrid Melle;,citation_author=Kjetil Sundet;,citation_author=Andrea Christoforou;,citation_author=Ivar Reinvang;,citation_author=Pamela DeRosse;,citation_author=Astri J Lundervold;,citation_author=Vidar M Steen;,citation_author=Thomas Espeseth;,citation_author=Katri Räikkönen;,citation_author=Elisabeth Widen;,citation_author=Aarno Palotie;,citation_author=Johan G Eriksson;,citation_author=Ina Giegling;,citation_author=Bettina Konte;,citation_author=Annette M Hartmann;,citation_author=Panos Roussos;,citation_author=Stella Giakoumaki;,citation_author=Katherine E Burdick;,citation_author=Antony Payton;,citation_author=William Ollier;,citation_author=Ornit Chiba-Falek;,citation_author=Deborah K Attix;,citation_author=Anna C Need;,citation_author=Elizabeth T Cirulli;,citation_author=Aristotle N Voineskos;,citation_author=Nikos C Stefanis;,citation_author=Dimitrios Avramopoulos;,citation_author=Alex Hatzimanolis;,citation_author=Dan E Arking;,citation_author=Nikolaos Smyrnis;,citation_author=Robert M Bilder;,citation_author=Nelson A Freimer;,citation_author=Tyrone D Cannon;,citation_author=Edythe London;,citation_author=Russell A Poldrack;,citation_author=Fred W Sabb;,citation_author=Eliza Congdon;,citation_author=Emily Drabant Conley;,citation_author=Matthew A Scult;,citation_author=Dwight Dickinson;,citation_author=Richard E Straub;,citation_author=Gary Donohoe;,citation_author=Derek Morris;,citation_author=Aiden Corvin;,citation_author=Michael Gill;,citation_author=Ahmad R Hariri;,citation_author=Daniel R Weinberger;,citation_author=Neil Pendleton;,citation_author=Panos Bitsios;,citation_author=Dan Rujescu;,citation_author=Jari Lahti;,citation_author=Stephanie Le Hellard;,citation_author=Matthew C Keller;,citation_author=Ole A Andreassen;,citation_author=Ian J Deary;,citation_author=David C Glahn;,citation_author=Anil K Malhotra;,citation_author=Todd Lencz;,citation_publication_date=2019-08;,citation_cover_date=2019-08;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374203

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mental fatigue and temporal preparation in simple reaction-time performance;,citation_abstract=Performance decrements attributed to mental fatigue have been found to be especially pronounced in tasks that involve the voluntary control of attention. Here we explored whether mental fatigue from prolonged time on task (TOT) also impairs temporal preparation for speeded action in a simple reaction-time task. Temporal preparation is enabled by a warning signal presented before the imperative stimulus and usually results in shorter reaction time (RT). When the delay between warning and imperative stimuli - the foreperiod (FP) - varies between trials, responses are faster with longer FPs. This pattern has been proposed to arise from either voluntary attentional processes (temporal orienting) or automatic trial-to-trial learning (trace conditioning). The former account suggests a selective RT increase on long-FP trials with fatigue; the latter account suggests no such change. Over a work period of 51 min, we found the typical increase in overall RT but no selective RT increase after long FPs. This additivity indicates that TOT-induced mental fatigue generally reduces cognitive efficiency but leaves temporal preparation under time uncertainty unaffected. We consider this result more consistent with the trace-conditioning account of temporal preparation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For permission to use (where not already granted under a licence) please go to http://group.bmj.com/group/rights-licensing/permissions. OBJECTIVE: To determine which potentially modifiable risk factors, including socioeconomic, lifestyle/dietary, cardiometabolic, and inflammatory factors, are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study using genetic variants associated with the modifiable risk factors as instrumental variables.SETTING: International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project.PARTICIPANTS: 17 008 cases of Alzheimer’s disease and 37 154 controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio of Alzheimer’s per genetically predicted increase in each modifiable risk factor estimated with Mendelian randomisation analysis.RESULTS: This study included analyses of 24 potentially modifiable risk factors. A Bonferroni corrected threshold of P=0.002 was considered to be significant, and P \textless0.05 was considered suggestive of evidence for a potential association. Genetically predicted educational attainment was significantly associated with Alzheimer’s. The odds ratios were 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.93; P=2.4×10-6) per year of education completed and 0.74 (0.63 to 0.86; P=8.0×10-5) per unit increase in log odds of having completed college/university. The correlated trait intelligence had a suggestive association with Alzheimer’s (per genetically predicted 1 SD higher intelligence: 0.73, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.01). There was suggestive evidence for potential associations between genetically predicted higher quantity of smoking (per 10 cigarettes a day: 0.69 , 0.49 to 0.99; P=0.04) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (per 20% higher levels: 0.92, 0.85 to 0.98; P=0.01) and lower odds of Alzheimer’s and between higher coffee consumption (per one cup a day: 1.26, 1.05 to 1.51; P=0.01) and higher odds of Alzheimer’s. Genetically predicted alcohol consumption, serum folate, serum vitamin B12, homocysteine, cardiometabolic factors, and C reactive protein were not associated with Alzheimer’s disease.CONCLUSION: These results provide support that higher educational attainment is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease.;,citation_author=Susanna C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sustained Activity Encoding Working Memories: Not Fully Distributed;,citation_abstract=Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity. We propose that robust sustained activity that can support WM coding arises as a property of association cortices downstream from the early stages of sensory processing.;,citation_author=Matthew L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimation of pleiotropy between complex diseases using single-nucleotide polymorphism-derived genomic relationships and restricted maximum likelihood.;,citation_abstract=SUMMARY: Genetic correlations are the genome-wide aggregate effects of causal variants affecting multiple traits. Traditionally , genetic correlations between complex traits are estimated from pedigree studies, but such estimates can be confounded by shared environmental factors. Moreover, for diseases, low prevalence rates imply that even if the true genetic correlation between disorders was high, co-aggregation of disorders in families might not occur or could not be distinguished from chance. We have developed and implemented statistical methods based on linear mixed models to obtain unbiased estimates of the genetic correlation between pairs of quantitative traits or pairs of binary traits of complex diseases using population-based case-control studies with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data. The method is validated in a simulation study and applied to estimate genetic correlation between various diseases from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data in a series of bivariate analyses. We estimate a significant positive genetic correlation between risk of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension of ∼0.31 (SE 0.14, P = 0.024).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals;,citation_abstract=Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1 million individuals and identify 1,271 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11–13% of the variance in educational attainment and 7–10% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.;,citation_author=James J.

The results indicate that significant WM deficit was present in schizophrenia patients in all modalities examined.

While prior research has shown a strong relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and working memory performance, the relation between SES and procedural (implicit) memory remains unknown. Convergent research in both animals and humans has revealed a fundamental dissociation, both behaviorally and neurally, between a working memory system that depends on medial temporal-lobe structures and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) vs. a procedural memory system that depends on the basal ganglia. Here, we measured performance in adolescents from lower- and higher-SES backgrounds on tests of working memory capacity (complex working memory span) and procedural memory (probabilistic classification) and their hippocampal, DLPFC, and caudate volumes. Lower-SES adolescents had worse working memory performance and smaller hippocampal and DLPFC volumes than their higher-SES peers, but there was no significant difference between the lower- and higher-SES groups on the procedural memory task or in caudate volumes. These findings suggest that SES may have a selective influence on hippocampal-prefrontal-dependent working memory and little influence on striatal-dependent procedural memory.;,citation_author=Julia A Leonard;,citation_author=Allyson P Mackey;,citation_author=Amy S Finn;,citation_author=John D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating Working Memory Deficits in Schizophrenia: A Review  of the Neurobiology;,citation_abstract=Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia. Among these deficits, working memory impairment is considered a central cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The prefrontal cortex, a region critical for working memory performance, has been demonstrated as a critical liability region in schizophrenia. As yet, there are no standardized treatment options for working memory deficits in schizophrenia. In this review, we summarize the neuronal basis for working memory impairment in schizophrenia, including dysfunction in prefrontal signaling pathways (e.g., γ-aminobutyric acid transmission) and neural network synchrony (e.g., gamma/theta oscillations). We discuss therapeutic strategies for working memory dysfunction such as pharmacological agents, cognitive remediation therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Despite the drawbacks of current approaches, the advances in neurobiological and translational treatment strategies suggest that clinical application of these methods will occur in the near future. © 2014 Society of Biological Psychiatry.;,citation_author=Tristram A.

Here we tested this hypothesis within a genetically informative design, using a large, nationally-representative twin sample. As predicted, heritable effects underlying community integration and existential uncertainty were strongly overlapping with the heritable influences on religiosity.

Through Meaning Theory, Victor Frankl and Paul Wong suggested that self-transcendence is a fundamental expression of our spiritual nature and a distinctive concept. However, it is not clear whether at present, with an extensive offer of individualistic currents, transcending involves a personal issue or is rather a collective issue, related to community and culture. The objective of this research is to determine if seeking personal transcendence and seeking collective transcendence are two differentiable categories, and if there is a priority among them, which would suggest an extension of the Theory. With the participation of 402 business students in Mexico, and with the help of a structured equation model, it was determined that there is a significant difference between orientation toward “I transcend” and the orientation toward “I help others transcend.” The results obtained from the selected sample indicate that individual transcendence and collective transcendence are distinguishable categories. In addition, it was found that young people prefer to seek a personal meaning rather than a collective one, which suggest that dimension of collective transcendence is prior to personal transcendence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Age, Step Direction, and Reaction Condition on the Ability to Step Quickly;,citation_abstract=Background. The ability to take a step quickly is important for balance maintenance during activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of age, reaction condition, and step direction on the ability to take a volitional step as fast as possible. Methods. The performance of a voluntary step task was measured in young adult (mean age 20, SD 0.9 years), young-old adult (mean age 67, SD 3.7 years), and old adult (mean age 78, SD 2.3 years) healthy female participants. Each participant stepped as fast as possible in eight directions in response to a visual cue in a simple or choice reaction time condition. The effects of age, reaction condition, and step direction and their interactions on the primary outcome variables of response time, step liftoff, and step landing time were examined. Results. The normal aging process progressively increased the response, liftoff, and landing times. The choice reaction time condition, compared to the simple, had significantly increased response, liftoff, and landing times. Step direction significantly affected the liftoff and landing times, with lateral, diagonal, and anterior and posterioir (A-P) times increasing, respectively. Conclusions. We found substantial declines in the ability to step rapidly in healthy adults as age increased. When a decision was required regarding the step direction, the step performance also declined. Step direction also significantly affected step performance. The assessment of voluntary step performance, which may be an indicator of balance ability, should include dimensions of both direction and the choice condition.;,citation_author=C. W.

Multivariate analysis, adjusted for test-retest reliability, showed the presence of a genetic factor influencing all variables and a genetic factor influencing 4- and 8-choice RTs, working memory, and IQ. There were also genetic factors specific to 8-choice RT, working memory, and IQ. The results confirmed a strong relationship between choice RT and IQ (phenotypic correlations: -0.31 to -0.53 in females, -0.32 to -0.56 in males; genotypic correlations: -0.45 to -0.70) and a weaker but significant association between working memory and IQ (phenotypic: 0.26 in females, 0.13 in males; genotypic: 0.34).

A debate has arisen over whether capacity is constrained by a limited number of discrete representations or by an infinitely divisible resource, but the empirical evidence and neural network models currently favor a discrete item limit.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Powerful Approach to Estimating Annotation-Stratified Genetic Covariance via GWAS Summary Statistics;,citation_abstract=Despite the success of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on complex traits, our understanding of their genetic architecture is far from complete. Jointly modeling multiple traits’ genetic profiles has provided insights into the shared genetic basis of many complex traits. However, large-scale inference sets a high bar for both statistical power and biological interpretability. Here we introduce a principled framework to estimate annotation-stratified genetic covariance between traits using GWAS summary statistics. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that our method provides accurate covariance estimates, thereby enabling researchers to dissect both the shared and distinct genetic architecture across traits to better understand their etiologies. Among 50 complex traits with publicly accessible GWAS summary statistics (N total ≈ 4.5 million) , we identified more than 170 pairs with statistically significant genetic covariance. In particular, we found strong genetic covariance between late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two major neurodegenerative diseases, in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high minor allele frequencies and in SNPs located in the predicted functional genome. Joint analysis of LOAD, ALS, and other traits highlights LOAD’s correlation with cognitive traits and hints at an autoimmune component for ALS.;,citation_author=Qiongshi Lu;,citation_author=Boyang Li;,citation_author=Derek Ou;,citation_author=Margret Erlendsdottir;,citation_author=Ryan L.

Importantly, when educational attainment was held constant, people with lower IQ test scores did not have higher mortality by age 70 than people with higher IQ test scores.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Embracing polygenicity: A review of methods and tools for psychiatric genetics research;,citation_abstract=The availability of genome-wide genetic data on hundreds of thousands of people has led to an equally rapid growth in methodologies available to analyse these data. While the motivation for undertaking genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is identification of genetic markers associated with complex traits, once generated these data can be used for many other analyses. GWAS have demonstrated that complex traits exhibit a highly polygenic genetic architecture, often with shared genetic risk factors across traits. New methods to analyse data from GWAS are increasingly being used to address a diverse set of questions about the aetiology of complex traits and diseases, including psychiatric disorders. Here, we give an overview of some of these methods and present examples of how they have contributed to our understanding of psychiatric disorders. We consider: (i) estimation of the extent of genetic influence on traits, (ii) uncovering of shared genetic control between traits, (iii) predictions of genetic risk for individuals, (iv) uncovering of causal relationships between traits , (v) identifying causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genes or (vi) the detection of genetic heterogeneity. This classification helps organise the large number of recently developed methods, although some could be placed in more than one category. While some methods require GWAS data on individual people, others simply use GWAS summary statistics data, allowing novel well-powered analyses to be conducted at a low computational burden.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Early life adversity shapes neural circuit function during sensitive postnatal developmental periods;,citation_abstract=Early life adversity (ELA) is a major risk factor for mental illness, but the neurobiological mechanisms by which ELA increases the risk for future psychopathology are still poorly understood. Brain development is particularly malleable during prenatal and early postnatal life, when complex neural circuits are being formed and refined through an interplay of excitatory and inhibitory neural input, synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, myelination, and neurogenesis. Adversity that influences these processes during sensitive periods of development can thus have long-lasting and pervasive effects on neural circuit maturation. In this review, we will discuss clinical and preclinical evidence for the impact of ELA on neural circuit formation with a focus on the early postnatal period, and how long-lasting impairments in these circuits can affect future behavior. We provide converging evidence from human and animal studies on how ELA alters the functional development of brain regions, neural circuits, and neurotransmitter systems that are crucial for cognition and affective behavior, including the hippocampus, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neural networks of fear responses and cognition, and the serotonin (5-HT) system. We also discuss how gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions can determine individual differences in susceptibility and resilience to ELA, as well as molecular pathways by which ELA regulates neural circuit development, for which we emphasize epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying ELA effects on brain function and psychopathology during early postnatal sensitive periods may have great potential to advance strategies to better treat or prevent psychiatric disorders that have their origin early in life.;,citation_author=Lauren Malave;,citation_author=Milenna T.

However, during the conduct of our study, we experienced multiple levels of failures in recruitment and retention that signaled potential concerns about the suitability of CWMT for adults with ADHD. This perspective piece aims to describe the difficulties we encountered in the context of studies examining the efficacy of CWMT in comparable populations. We trace these difficulties to the limited tolerability of the current CWMT structure for adults with ADHD, and review similar limitations in the literature. We suggest that efficacy of CWMT in children may be due in large part to close monitoring and scaffolding provided by clinicians and caregivers. For CWMT to have viability for widespread use in adults, greater support and structure will be needed for users to improve the likelihood of adherence.

The goal of the study was to evaluate informant effects on adult ADHD symptom ratings. Participants were 406 adults, ages 18 to 37, and identified second reporters, recruited from the community, and completing a comprehensive diagnostic and cognitive assessment, including a clinicianadministered diagnostic interview and self- and other-report questionnaires of ADHD symptoms. Structural equation modeling indicated good fit for a trifactor model of ADHD, including general ADHD, specific inattention and hyperactivity–impulsivity, and self- and other-perspective factors. Yet there were a number of symptoms on the specific hyperactive–impulsive and self-factors that exhibited nonsignificant loadings. Significant differential item functioning across self-ratings and informant ratings was also noted. The external validation indices of laboratory executive function and diagnostic teamrated impairment was significantly correlated with the specific inattentive factor. While executive function was marginally significantly correlated with the other perspective factor, impairment was associated with the self-perspective factor.

Consistent with predictions, results indicated that the startle reflex habituated after several presentations of the SAS for the choice RT group but not for the simple RT group, which we attributed to advance motor preparatory processes involved in a simple RT task. Additionally, when participants from the choice RT group were put into a simple RT condition, the startle reflex response returned to nonhabituated levels.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Control of response timing occurs during the simple reaction time interval but on-line for choice reaction time;,citation_abstract=The preparation of multiple element movements has been examined for decades, with no clear explanation offered for the disparate results observed. Results from 2 experiments are presented and, in conjunction with previous results, a theoretical interpretation is offered regarding the preparatory processes that occur before, during and after the reaction time (RT) interval for multiple element movements during both simple and choice RT paradigms. In Experiment 1, number of elements and timing complexity were manipulated in a simple RT key-press task, using a startling acoustic stimulus to probe advance preparation. Both startle and nonstartle RT increased with number of movement elements and for a movement with increased timing complexity, providing evidence that the control of response timing occurs during the RT interval. In Experiment 2, the production of key-press movements of varying number of elements was compared in a simple versus choice RT paradigm. Results indicated that simple RT was affected by the number of elements, yet choice RT was not. Additionally, choice RT trials showed significantly longer interresponse intervals compared with those observed in simple RT trials, providing evidence for online processing in choice RT. The results of both studies, together with previous findings, suggest that planning of the timing of the onsets of the elements is prepared during simple RT, whereas planning of other aspects of the sequence of elements seems to occur in the foreperiod prior to the &amp;amp;amp;quot;go&amp;quot; signal.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Independent planning of timing and sequencing for complex movements;,citation_abstract=The current studies examined the processes involved in response sequencing and timing initiation for complex, multiple-component movements. Participants performed a 3 key-press sequence in simple and choice reaction time (RT) paradigms (Experiment 1), or a study time paradigm that allowed the participants to control the foreperiod delay, which is thought to reflect advance preparation duration (Experiment 2). Sequencing complexity was manipulated by using either the same hand and effector for all key presses (low complexity) or different hands/effectors across key presses (high complexity) while timing initiation complexity was manipulated by using either an isochronous (low complexity) or nonisochronous (high complexity) timing pattern. Increasing sequencing complexity had little effect on simple RT but increased participant-controlled foreperiod delay (i.e., study time). Conversely, increasing timing initiation complexity had no effect on foreperiod delay but increased simple RT. These results provide compelling evidence that in a simple RT paradigm, sequencing preparation is performed during the foreperiod while preparation of timing initiation is delayed until the RT interval. Furthermore, choice RT increased with sequencing complexity and was relatively unaffected by timing initiation complexity, indicative of sequencing preparation occurring during the choice RT interval and preparation of timing initiation occurring online.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigation of timing preparation during response initiation and execution using a startling acoustic stimulus;,citation_abstract=The purpose of the current study was to examine the processes involved in the preparation of timing during response initiation and execution through the use of a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS). In Experiment 1, participants performed a delayed response task in which a two key-press movement was to be initiated 200 ms after an imperative signal (IS) with either a short (200 ms) or long (500 ms) interval between key-presses. On selected trials, a SAS was presented to probe the preparation processes associated with the initiation delay and execution of the inter-key interval. The SAS resulted in a significant decrease in the initiation time, which was attributed to a speeding of pacemaker pulses used to time the delay interval, caused by an increased activation due to the SAS. Conversely, the SAS delayed the short inter-key interval, which was attributed to temporary interference with cortical processing. In Experiment 2, participants performed a 500-ms delayed response task involving two key-presses 200 ms apart. In this condition, the SAS resulted in significantly decreased initiation time and a delayed inter-key interval (p = .053). Collectively, these results support a different timeline for the preparation of the delay interval, which is thought to be prepared in advance of the IS, and the inter-key interval, which is thought to be prepared following the IS.

In two experiments, participants performed a reaction time (RT) task involving a three key-press sequence with either a simple (isochronous) or complex (non-isochronous) timing structure. Conditions involved a precue that provided information about all features of the movement (simple RT), no features of the movement (choice RT), sequencing only, or timing structure only. When sequencing was precued, RT decreased significantly as compared to choice RT, indicative of advance preparation of sequencing. When timing was precued, RT decreased significantly compared to choice RT when the timing structure was simple, suggesting that some aspect of timing preparation can occur prior to the go stimulus. However, even when the timing structure was known in advance, RT was still affected by timing complexity, confirming that some aspect of timing preparation cannot occur until after the onset of the stimulus and thus occurs during the RT interval. To explain these findings, we propose a two-component model of preparation for the timing initiation structure in which timing selection occurs in advance but timing implementation must occur following the go signal.

Rare variants were analyzed using the optimal unified sequence kernel association test. The significance threshold was defined as a false discovery rate-corrected p-value (P FDR ) of 0.05.

Although the medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the representation and reduction of a variety of uncertainties, it is unknown whether different types of uncertainty are distinguished by distinct neuronal populations. To investigate how the prefrontal cortex distinguishes between different types of uncertainty, we recorded neuronal activities from the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices of monkeys performing a visual feedback-based action-learning task in which uncertainty of coming feedback and that of context change varied asynchronously. We found that the activities of two groups of prefrontal cells represented the two different types of uncertainty.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Clinical prediction models in psychiatry: A systematic review of two decades of progress and challenges;,citation_abstract=Recent years have seen the rapid proliferation of clinical prediction models aiming to support risk stratification and individualized care within psychiatry. Despite growing interest, attempts to synthesize current evidence in the nascent field of precision psychiatry have remained scarce. This systematic review therefore sought to summarize progress towards clinical implementation of prediction modeling for psychiatric outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases from inception to September 30, 2020, for English-language articles that developed and/or validated multivariable models to predict (at an individual level) onset, course, or treatment response for non-organic psychiatric disorders (PROSPERO: CRD42020216530). Individual prediction models were evaluated based on three key criteria: (i) mitigation of bias and overfitting; (ii) generalizability, and (iii) clinical utility. The Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to formally appraise each study’s risk of bias. 228 studies detailing 308 prediction models were ultimately eligible for inclusion. 94.5% of developed prediction models were deemed to be at high risk of bias, largely due to inadequate or inappropriate analytic decisions. Insufficient internal validation efforts (within the development sample) were also observed, while only one-fifth of models underwent external validation in an independent sample. Finally, our search identified just one published model whose potential utility in clinical practice was formally assessed. Our findings illustrated significant growth in precision psychiatry with promising progress towards real-world application. Nevertheless, these efforts have been inhibited by a preponderance of bias and overfitting, while the generalizability and clinical utility of many published models has yet to be formally established. Through improved methodological rigor during initial development, robust evaluations of reproducibility via independent validation, and evidence-based implementation frameworks, future research has the potential to generate risk prediction tools capable of enhancing clinical decision-making in psychiatric care.;,citation_author=Alan J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Creatine supplementation in the pediatric and adolescent athlete–  A literature review;,citation_abstract=Background: An increase in intra-muscular creatine through supplementation has been proposed as a strategy for improving muscle performance and recovery, with studies showing some benefit for adult athletes who rely on short, explosive movements. We reviewed and summarized the current literature on creatine supplementation in a pediatric and adolescent population. Methods: The databases PubMed and EMBASE were queried to identity articles related to the use of creatine supplementation in a healthy pediatric and adolescent population according to the guidelines established by PRISMA. The abstracts of all articles were reviewed to determine relevancy, with those meeting the pre-defined criteria included in the final review. Results: A combined total of 9393 articles were identified. Following application of filters and review of abstracts, 13 articles were found to meet criteria and were included in the final review. There was a total of 268 subjects across all studies, with mean age ranging from 11.5 to 18.2 years. More than 75% of the studies were randomized-controlled trials, and 85% involved either soccer players or swimmers. The overall quality of the studies was poor, and there were no consistent findings regarding creatine supplementation and improvements in athletic performance. No studies were designed to address the topic of safety. Conclusions: There is a gap in the study of the safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in adolescents. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effects of alterations in muscle composition on the growth, development, and performance of the developing athlete. Orthopedic providers should counsel their pediatric and adolescent patients on the current limitations in trying to assess the true risk and benefit of creatine sup­ plementation for the aspiring athlete.;,citation_author=Gregory A.

The current studies tested whether the modality of administration of the Letter‐Number Sequencing task affects performance on the task. The Letter‐Number Sequencing task is a WMC measure included as part of the WAIS‐III and WAIS‐IV test batteries. The task involves hearing a series of letters and digits , and then reporting back the stimuli with the letters in alphabetical order, and digits in ascending numerical order. The task is traditionally administered orally, but recent studies have administered versions of the tasks visually by displaying stimuli on a computer screen. Results suggest that performance differences on the Letter‐Number Sequencing task may arise as a function of language background and task administration modality.;,citation_author=Marta K.

Because of their radically different scopes and emphases, however, comparing different models and theories and understanding how they relate to one another has been a difficult task. This work offers a much-needed forum for systematically comparing and contrasting existing models of working memory. It does so by asking each contributor to address the same comprehensive set of important theoretical questions on working memory. The answers to these questions elucidate the emerging general consensus on the nature of working memory among different theorists and clarify incompatible theoretical claims that must be resolved in future research. As such, this volume serves not only as a milestone that documents the state of the art in the field, but also as a theoretical guidebook that will promote new lines of research and more precise and comprehensive models of working memory.;,citation_author=Akira Miyake;,citation_author=Priti Shah;,citation_publication_date=1999;,citation_cover_date=1999;,citation_year=1999;,citation_fulltext_html_url=

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic influence on cognitive development between childhood and adulthood;,citation_abstract=Successful cognitive development between childhood and adulthood has important consequences for future mental and physical wellbeing , as well as occupational and financial success. Therefore, delineating the genetic influences underlying changes in cognitive abilities during this developmental period will provide important insights into the biological mechanisms that govern both typical and atypical maturation. Using data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a large population-based sample of individuals aged 8 to 21 years old (n = 6634), we used an empirical relatedness matrix to establish the heritability of general and specific cognitive functions and determine if genetic factors influence cognitive maturation (i.e., Gene × Age interactions) between childhood and early adulthood. We found that neurocognitive measures across childhood and early adulthood were significantly heritable. Moreover, genetic variance on general cognitive ability, or g, increased significantly between childhood and early adulthood. Finally, we did not find evidence for decay in genetic correlation on neurocognition throughout childhood and adulthood, suggesting that the same genetic factors underlie cognition at different ages throughout this developmental period. Establishing significant Gene × Age interactions in neurocognitive functions across childhood and early adulthood is a necessary first step in identifying genes that influence cognitive development, rather than genes that influence cognition per se. Moreover, since aberrant cognitive development confers risk for several psychiatric disorders, further examination of these Gene ×  Age interactions may provide important insights into their etiology.;,citation_author=Josephine Mollon;,citation_author=Emma E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=I Doubt It Is Safe: A Meta-analysis of Self-reported Intolerance of Uncertainty and Threat Extinction Training;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), the tendency to find uncertainty distressing, is an important transdiagnostic dimension in mental health disorders. Higher self-reported IU has been linked to poorer threat extinction training (i.e., the updating of threat to safe associations), a key process that is targeted in exposure-based therapies. However, it remains to be seen whether IU-related effects during threat extinction training are reliably and specifically driven by the IU construct or a particular subcomponent of the IU construct over other self-reported measures of anxiety. METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies from different laboratories (18 experiments; sample N = 1006) was conducted on associations between different variants of self-reported IU (i.e., 27-item, 12-item, inhibitory, and prospective subscales), trait anxiety, and threat extinction training via skin conductance response. The specificity of IU and threat extinction training was assessed against measures of trait anxiety. RESULTS: All the self-reported variants of IU, but not trait anxiety, were associated with threat extinction training via skin conductance response (i.e., continued responding to the old threat cue). Specificity was observed for the majority of self-reported variants of IU over trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the IU construct broadly accounts for difficulties in threat extinction training and is specific over other measures of self-reported anxiety. These findings demonstrate the robustness and specificity of IU-related effects during threat extinction training and highlight potential opportunities for translational work to target uncertainty in therapies that rely on threat extinction principles such as exposure therapy.;,citation_author=Jayne Morriss;,citation_author=Shannon Wake;,citation_author=Charlotte Elizabeth;,citation_author=Carien M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with reduced attentional inhibition in the absence of direct threat;,citation_abstract=Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional tendency to find uncertain situations aversive. There is limited understanding as to how IU may bias attention to uncertainty in the absence of direct threat. Here we examined the extent to which uncertain distractors and individual differences in IU impacted eye-movements during an attentional capture task. Participants were asked to move their eyes towards a target, whilst ignoring an array of distractors. An additional distractor could appear before or after the target in a near or far location from the target. We observed high IU individuals to display fewer first saccades to the target in all conditions. The results were specific to IU, over trait anxiety. Overall, these results suggest that IU modulates attention to uncertainty in the absence of direct threat.

Given its relevance to psychopathology and wellbeing, recent research has begun to address the brain basis of uncertainty. In the current review we examined whether there are discrete and shared neural signatures for different uncertain contexts. From the literature we identified three broad categories of uncertainty currently empirically studied using functional MRI (fMRI): basic threat and reward uncertainty, decision-making under uncertainty, and associative learning under uncertainty. We examined the neural basis of each category by using a coordinate based meta-analysis, where brain activation foci from previously published fMRI experiments were drawn together (1998–2017; 87 studies). The analyses revealed shared and discrete patterns of neural activation for uncertainty, such as the insula and amygdala, depending on the category.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Thalamic circuits for independent control of prefrontal signal and noise;,citation_abstract=Abstract Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus and the prefrontal cortex are critical for cognition. Studies in humans indicate that these interactions may resolve uncertainty in decision-making 1 , but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we identify two distinct mediodorsal projections to the prefrontal cortex that have complementary mechanistic roles in decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we found that a dopamine receptor (D2)-expressing projection amplifies prefrontal signals when task inputs are sparse and a kainate receptor (GRIK4) expressing-projection suppresses prefrontal noise when task inputs are dense but conflicting. Collectively, our data suggest that there are distinct brain mechanisms for handling uncertainty due to low signals versus uncertainty due to high noise, and provide a mechanistic entry point for correcting decision-making abnormalities in disorders that have a prominent prefrontal component 2–6 .;,citation_author=Arghya Mukherjee;,citation_author=Norman H.

Method: A sample of 238 undergraduate students was recruited and asked to simulate ADHD (ADHD simulators) or respond honestly (controls) on the PAI. Archival data ( n = 541) from individuals diagnosed with clinical ADHD, no diagnosis, learning disorder, mood/anxiety, comorbid ADHD-mood/anxiety, or suspect effort were used. Results: Few individuals scored above the cutoffs on PAI validity scales. When alternative cutoff scores were examined, cutoffs of ≥77 on the Negative Impression Management (NIM) scale, ≥3 on the Malingering Index (MAL), and ≥1 on the Rogers Discriminant Function (RDF) yielded excellent specificity in all groups and sensitivities of .33, .30, and .20, respectively.

Among all working memory components, phonological complex memory contributed most to predicting all three reading abilities. A capacity measure of phonological complex memory, based on passing a minimum threshold in those tasks, contributed to the explained variance of decoding and reading comprehension. Findings suggest that a minimal ability of phonological complex memory is necessary for children to attain a normal reading level. Adding assessment of phonological complex memory, before formal teaching of reading begins, to more common measures might better estimate children’s likelihood of future academic success.;,citation_author=Einat Nevo;,citation_author=Zvia Breznitz;,citation_publication_date=2011-05;,citation_cover_date=2011-05;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022096510001955;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.09.010;,citation_issn=00220965;,citation_volume=109;,citation_journal_title=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reaction time, symptom profiles and course of illness in schizophrenia;,citation_abstract=Schizophrenic subjects perform more poorly than normal controls on a wide range of neurocognitive tasks. Some studies suggest that patients with persistent illness may have different patterns of cognitive deficits and different associations between cognitive deficits and symptom profiles compared with patients with fluctuating illness. This study uses simple reaction time, choice reaction time and Stroop tasks to explore the relationship between reaction time and symptom profiles in patients with fluctuating illness (n=24), persistent illness (n=17) and normal controls (n=16). We tested the hypothesis that in patients with persistent illness, psychomotor poverty is associated with impaired initiation of activity, and that disorganization is associated with impaired selection in both persistent and fluctuating illness. There were no differences in the severity of symptoms in the patient groups. In the simple reaction time task, patients with persistent illness performed more poorly than patients with fluctuating illness and controls. Both patient groups performed more poorly than controls in the choice reaction time tasks. Psychomotor poverty was associated with simple reaction time in patients with persistent symptoms. Disorganization was associated with poorer performance on the choice reaction time task in both patient groups. These results suggest the possibility that persistent illness, negative symptoms, and impaired initiation may reflect dysfunction associated with enduring structural abnormalities. In the case of impaired selection processes and disorganization, our data indicate that these abnormalities occur in both persistent and fluctuating illness. This suggests that enduring brain damage might create a predisposition to impaired selection and disorganization, but these clinical features can also arise as a result of transient biochemical imbalance. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Variability in Working Memory Performance Explained by  Epistasis vs Polygenic Scores in the ZNF804A Pathway;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: We investigated the variation in neuropsychological function explained by risk alleles at the psychosis susceptibility gene ZNF804A and its interacting partners using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), polygenic scores, and epistatic analyses. Of particular importance was the relative contribution of the polygenic score vs epistasis in variation explained.$ \backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To (1) assess the association between SNPs in ZNF804A and the ZNF804A polygenic score with measures of cognition in cases with psychosis and (2) assess whether epistasis within the ZNF804A pathway could explain additional variation above and beyond that explained by the polygenic score.$\backslash$n$ \backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with psychosis (n = 424) were assessed in areas of cognitive ability impaired in schizophrenia including IQ, memory, attention, and social cognition. We used the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium 1 schizophrenia genome-wide association study to calculate a polygenic score based on identified risk variants within this genetic pathway. Cognitive measures significantly associated with the polygenic score were tested for an epistatic component using a training set (n = 170), which was used to develop linear regression models containing the polygenic score and 2-SNP interactions. The best-fitting models were tested for replication in 2 independent test sets of cases: (1) 170 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and (2) 84 patients with broad psychosis (including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and other psychosis).$\backslash$n$ \backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment battery designed to target the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia including general cognitive function, episodic memory, working memory, attentional control, and social cognition.$\backslash$n$ \backslash$nRESULTS: Higher polygenic scores were associated with poorer performance among patients on IQ, memory, and social cognition, explaining 1% to 3% of variation on these scores (range, P = .01 to .03). Using a narrow psychosis training set and independent test sets of narrow phenotype psychosis (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder), broad psychosis, and control participants (n = 89), the addition of 2 interaction terms containing 2 SNPs each increased the R2 for spatial working memory strategy in the independent psychosis test sets from 1.2% using the polygenic score only to 4.8% (P = .11 and .001, respectively) but did not explain additional variation in control participants.$ \backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data support a role for the ZNF804A pathway in IQ, memory, and social cognition in cases. Furthermore, we showed that epistasis increases the variation explained above the contribution of the polygenic score.;,citation_author=Kristin K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimation of Genetic Correlation via Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression and Genomic Restricted Maximum Likelihood;,citation_abstract=Genetic correlation is a key population parameter that describes the shared genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. It can be estimated by current state-of-art methods, i.e., linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML). The massively reduced computing burden of LDSC compared to GREML makes it an attractive tool, although the accuracy (i.e., magnitude of standard errors) of LDSC estimates has not been thoroughly studied. In simulation, we show that the accuracy of GREML is generally higher than that of LDSC. When there is genetic heterogeneity between the actual sample and reference data from which LD scores are estimated, the accuracy of LDSC decreases further. In real data analyses estimating the genetic correlation between schizophrenia (SCZ) and body mass index, we show that GREML estimates based on ∼150,000 individuals give a higher accuracy than LDSC estimates based on ∼400,000 individuals (from combined meta-data). A GREML genomic partitioning analysis reveals that the genetic correlation between SCZ and height is significantly negative for regulatory regions, which whole genome or LDSC approach has less power to detect. We conclude that LDSC estimates should be carefully interpreted as there can be uncertainty about homogeneity among combined meta-datasets. We suggest that any interesting findings from massive LDSC analysis for a large number of complex traits should be followed up, where possible, with more detailed analyses with GREML methods, even if sample sizes are lesser.;,citation_author=Guiyan Ni;,citation_author=Gerhard Moser;,citation_author=Stephan Ripke;,citation_author=Benjamin M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluating the unique contribution of intolerance of uncertainty relative to other cognitive vulnerability factors in anxiety psychopathology;,citation_abstract=Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a cognitive vulnerability factor associated with a wide range of anxiety psychopathology. Other cognitive vulnerabilities such as anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and discomfort intolerance (DI) have also been investigated as constructs of interest across anxiety disorders. As researchers increasingly uncover viable transdiagnostic vulnerabilities to anxiety, it becomes important to determine the degree of overlap between these constructs. Methods: The present studies examined the unique relationships between IU, other vulnerability factors (AS, DT, and DI) and social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and worry symptoms across two nonclinical samples (n ¼ 217, n ¼ 241). Results: Findings were highly consistent across samples. IU was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms in all analyses, even when accounting for other transdiagnostic risk variables. Anxiety sensitivity, was uniquely related to social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in all analyses, but was related to worry in only one study. Distress tolerance was only uniquely associated with worry. Discomfort intolerance was not uniquely related to the anxiety symptoms in any analyses. Limitations: Future research should attempt to replicate the findings in a clinical population and utilize a longitudinal design. Conclusions: The robust and incremental relationships between IU and anxiety symptoms suggests the potential benefit of targeting IU in the context of transdiagnostic anxiety treatments. &amp;amp;amp; 2013 Elsevier B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working Memory and Intelligence–Their Correlation and  Their Relation: Comment on Ackerman, Beier, and Boyle  (2005).;,citation_abstract=On the basis of a meta-analysis of pairwise correlations between working memory tasks and cognitive ability measures, P. L. Ackerman , M. E. Beier, and M. O. Boyle (2005; see record 2004-22408-002) claimed that working memory capacity (WMC) shares less than 25% of its variance with general intelligence (g) and with reasoning ability. In this comment, the authors argue that this is an underestimation because of several methodological shortcomings and biases. A reanalysis of the data reported in Ackerman et al. using the correct statistical procedures demonstrates that g and WMC are very highly correlated. On a conceptual level, the authors point out that WMC should be regarded as an explanatory construct for intellectual abilities. Theories of working memory do not claim that WMC is isomorphic with intelligence factors but that it is a very strong predictor of reasoning ability and also predicts general fluid intelligence and g.;,citation_author=Klaus Oberauer;,citation_author=Ralf Schulze;,citation_author=Oliver Wilhelm;,citation_author=Heinz-Martin Süß;,citation_publication_date=2005-01;,citation_cover_date=2005-01;,citation_year=2005;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.61;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.61;,citation_issn=1939-1455;,citation_volume=131;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychol.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Female and male antisocial trajectories: From childhood origins to adult outcomes;,citation_abstract=This article reports on the childhood origins and adult outcomes of female versus male antisocial behavior trajectories in the Dunedin longitudinal study. Four antisocial behavior trajectory groups were identified among females and males using general growth mixture modeling and included life-course persistent (LCP), adolescent-onset, childhood-limited, and low trajectory groups. During childhood, both LCP females and males were characterized by social, familial and neurodevelopmental risk factors, whereas those on the adolescent-onset pathway were not. At age 32, women and men on the LCP pathway were engaging in serious violence and experiencing significant mental health, physical health, and economic problems. Females and males on the adolescent-onset pathway were also experiencing difficulties at age 32, although to a lesser extent. Although more males than females followed the LCP trajectory, findings support similarities across gender with respect to developmental trajectories of antisocial behavior and their associated childhood origins and adult consequences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The power of genome-wide association studies of complex disease genes: Statistical limitations of indirect approaches using SNP  markers;,citation_abstract=Genome-wide association studies using a dense map of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers seem to enable us to detect a number of complex disease genes. In such indirect association studies, whether susceptibility genes can be detected is dependent not only on the degree of linkage disequilibrium between the disease variant and the SNP marker but also on the difference in their allele frequencies. These factors, as well as penetrance of the disease variant, influence the statistical power of such approaches. However, the power of indirect association studies is not well understood. We calculated the number of individuals necessary for the detection of the disease variant in both direct and indirect association studies with a case-control design. The result shows that a remarkable reduction in the statistical power of indirect studies, compared with that of direct ones, is unavoidable in the genome-wide screening of complex disease genes. If there is a large difference in allele frequency between the disease variant and the marker, the disease variant cannot be detected. Because the frequency of the disease variant is unknown, SNP markers with various allele frequencies, or a large number of SNP markers, must be used in indirect association studies. However, if the number of SNP markers is increased, the obtained P value may not reach the significance level due to the Bonferroni adjustment. Thus, to test a possible association between functional variants and a complex disease directly, we should identify such SNPs in as many genes as possible for use in genome-wide association studies.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Testing Multiple Conceptualizations of Oppositional Defiant Disorder in Youth;,citation_abstract=Recent theories conceptualize oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as a two-dimensional construct with angry/irritable (i.e., affective) and argumentative/defiant (i.e., behavioral) components. This view has been supported by studies of nonreferred youth but not yet examined in clinic-referred youth. In a reanalysis of data regarding children who received one of two psychosocial ODD treatments, we examined multiple conceptualizations of ODD, whether children showed improvements across these ODD dimensions, and whether main and joint effects of ODD dimension improvement predicted clinical outcome. One hundred thirty-four clinic-referred youth (ages 7–14 years, 38% female, 84% White) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) criteria for ODD received 1 of 2 psychosocial treatments. At pretreatment, 1-week follow-up, and 6-month follow-up, mothers reported child aggression and conduct problems, clinicians reported global clinical impairment and clinical improvement, and ODD symptom counts were collected from a semistructured diagnostic interview with mothers. Baseline ODD symptom were used to test previously supported multidimensional models. One- and two-factor conceptualizations were supported; however, the two-factor solution was preferred. With this solution, each dimension significantly and similarly improved across treatment conditions. Improvements across affective and behavioral ODD factors also had significant effects on clinician- and mother-reported clinical outcomes. The current findings provide empirical support for the ongoing study of multidimensional ODD conceptualizations in clinic-referred youth.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Environmental influences on child health outcomes: Cohorts of individuals born very preterm;,citation_abstract=The National Institutes of Health’s Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program was designed to address solution-oriented research questions about the links between children’s early life environment and their risks of pre-, peri-, and post-natal complications, asthma, obesity, neurodevelopmental disorders, and positive health. Children born very preterm are at increased risk for many of the outcomes on which ECHO focuses, but the contributions of environmental factors to this risk are not well characterized. Three ECHO cohorts consist almost exclusively of individuals born very preterm. Data provided to ECHO from cohorts can be used to address hypotheses about (1) differential risks of chronic health and developmental conditions between individuals born very preterm and those born at term; (2) health disparities across social determinants of health; and (3) mechanisms linking early-life exposures and later-life outcomes among individuals born very preterm. IMPACT: The National Institutes of Health’s Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes Program is conducting solution-oriented research on the links between children’s environment and health. Three ECHO cohorts comprise study participants born very preterm; these cohorts have enrolled, to date, 1751 individuals born in 14 states in the U.S. in between April 2002 and March 2020. Extensive data are available on early-life environmental exposures and child outcomes related to neurodevelopment, asthma, obesity, and positive health.

We performed a genome-wide survey at 909 622 polymorphic loci and report six genetic variations significantly associated with human short-term memory performance after genome-wide correction for multiple comparisons. A polymorphism within SCN1A (encoding the α subunit of the type I voltage-gated sodium channel) was replicated in three independent populations of 1699 individuals.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceptions of aggressive conflicts and others’ distress in children with callous-unemotional traits: ’I’ll show you who’s boss, even if you suffer and I get in trouble’;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits may have a particularly malevolent view of social conflicts and a pervasive insensitivity to others’ distress. The current study examined whether children with CU traits have unique expectations and values regarding the consequences of aggressive conflicts and a ubiquitous lack of concern for others’ feelings independent of co-occurring aggression. METHODS: Participants were 96 (46 males, 50 females) children recruited from elementary schools within an urban city. Associations between CU traits and child reports of outcome expectancies/values following aggressive conflicts and facets of empathy were examined after controlling for aggression, academic abilities, and demographic covariates. RESULTS: Children with higher CU traits were less likely to expect that aggression would result in victim suffering and feelings of remorse. After controlling for co-occurring aggression, children with higher CU traits were more likely to expect that aggression would result in peer dominance, while children with higher levels of aggression were more likely to expect that attacking others would reduce their aversive behavior. Children with higher CU traits were less concerned that aggressive behavior would result in punishment, victim suffering, and feelings of remorse. Moreover, children with higher CU traits reported lower levels of empathetic concern and sadness in response to others’ distress outside of aggressive conflicts. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CU traits tend to minimize the extent to which aggression causes victim suffering and openly acknowledge caring less about distress and suffering in others. They are less intimidated by the possibility of being punished for aggressive behavior and tend to view aggression as an effective means for dominating others. In sum, children with CU traits have a particularly malicious social schema that may be difficult to change using conventional treatment methods.;,citation_author=Dustin A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology explain individuals’ unique deviations from normative neurodevelopment in brain structure;,citation_abstract=Psychopathology is rooted in neurodevelopment. However, clinical and biological heterogeneity, together with a focus on case-control approaches, have made it difficult to link dimensions of psychopathology to abnormalities of neurodevelopment. Here, using the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we built normative models of cortical volume and tested whether deviations from these models better predicted psychiatric symptoms compared to raw cortical volume. Specifically, drawing on the p-factor hypothesis, we distilled 117 clinical symptom measures into six orthogonal psychopathology dimensions: overall psychopathology, anxious-misery , externalizing disorders, fear, positive psychosis symptoms, and negative psychosis symptoms. We found that multivariate patterns of deviations yielded improved out-of-sample prediction of psychopathology dimensions compared to multivariate patterns of raw cortical volume. We also found that correlations between overall psychopathology and deviations in ventromedial prefrontal, inferior temporal, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices were stronger than those observed for specific dimensions of psychopathology (e.g., anxious-misery). Notably, these same regions are consistently implicated in a range of putatively distinct disorders. Finally, we performed conventional case-control comparisons of deviations in a group of individuals with depression and a group with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We observed spatially overlapping effects between these groups that diminished when controlling for overall psychopathology. Together, our results suggest that modeling cortical brain features as deviations from normative neurodevelopment improves prediction of psychiatric symptoms in out-of-sample testing, and that p-factor models of psychopathology may assist in separating biomarkers that are disorder-general from those that are disorder-specific.;,citation_author=Linden Parkes;,citation_author=Tyler M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working memory impairment as an endophenotypic marker of a schizophrenia diathesis;,citation_abstract=This review focuses on the viability of working memory impairment as an endophenotypic marker of a schizophrenia diathesis. It begins with an introduction of the construct of working memory. It follows with a consideration of the operational criteria for defining an endophenotype. Research findings regarding the working memory performance of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-spectrum patients, first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, are reviewed in terms of the criteria for being considered an endophenotypic marker. Special attention is paid to specific components of the working memory deficit (namely, encoding , maintenance, and manipulation), in terms of which aspects are likely to be the best candidates for endophenotypes. We examine the extant literature regarding working memory performance in bipolar disorder and major depression in order to address the issue of relative specificity to schizophrenia. Despite some unresolved issues, it appears that working memory impairment is a very promising candidate for an endophenotypic marker of a schizophrenia diathesis but not for mood disorders. Throughout this review, we identify future directions for research in this exciting and dynamic area of research and evaluate the contribution of working memory research to our understanding of schizophrenia.;,citation_author=Sohee Park;,citation_author=Diane C.

Over the past fourteen years genetic research has aimed to identify the polymorphisms responsible for high cognitive functioning and successful cognitive ageing.

Theoretical propositions suggest that one form, unexpected uncertainty, may be used to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, while being influenced by two other forms: risk and estimation uncertainty. While previous studies have reported neural representations of estimation uncertainty and risk, relatively little is known about unexpected uncertainty. Here, participants performed a decision-making task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which, in combination with a Bayesian model-based analysis, enabled us to separately examine each form of uncertainty examined. We found representations of unexpected uncertainty in multiple cortical areas, as well as the noradrenergic brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus. Other unique cortical regions were found to encode risk, estimation uncertainty, and learning rate. Collectively, these findings support theoretical models in which several formally separable uncertainty computations determine the speed of learning.;,citation_author=Elise Payzan-LeNestour;,citation_author=Simon Dunne;,citation_author=Peter Bossaerts;,citation_author=John P.

The secondary purpose of the study was to identify how individual differences in brain activation were related to participants’ nonword repetition abilities. Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neurophysiological response during a nonword discrimination task derived from standard clinical assessments of phonological working memory. Healthy adult control participants (N = 16) discriminated pairs of real words or nonwords under varying phonological working memory load, which we manipulated by parametrically varying the number of syllables in target (non)words. Participants’ cognitive and phonological abilities were also measured using standardized assessments. Results: Neurophysiological responses in bilateral superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area increased with greater phonological working memory load. Activation in left superior temporal gyrus during nonword discrimination correlated with participants’ performance on standard clinical nonword repetition tests.

Strength of evidence and applicability assessments followed Evidence-based Practice Center standards. RESULTS: In total, 231 studies met eligibility criteria. Studies evaluated parental ratings, teacher ratings, youth self-reports, clinician tools, neuropsychological tests, biospecimen, EEG, and neuroimaging. Multiple tools showed promising diagnostic performance, but estimates varied considerably across studies, with a generally low strength of evidence. Performance depended on whether ADHD youth were being differentiated from neurotypically developing children or from clinically referred children. LIMITATIONS: Studies used different components of available tools and did not report sufficient data for meta-analytic models.

We grouped evidence for medication, psychosocial interventions, parent support , nutrition and supplements, neurofeedback, neurostimulation, physical exercise, complementary medicine, school interventions, and provider approaches. Several treatments improved ADHD symptoms. Medications had the strongest evidence base for improving outcomes, including disruptive behaviors and broadband measures, but were associated with adverse events. LIMITATIONS: We found limited evidence of studies comparing alternative treatments directly and indirect analyses identified few systematic differences across stimulants and nonstimulants. Identified combination of medication with youth-directed psychosocial interventions did not systematically produce better results than monotherapy, though few combinations have been evaluated.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mendelian randomization integrating GWAS and eQTL data reveals genetic determinants of complex and clinical traits;,citation_abstract=Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene-trait associations, 36% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections.

Objectives The present study examines the association between formal volunteering and cognitive functioning over time. We also examine the moderating roles of race, sex, education, and time. Method Using 11,100 participants aged 51 years and older and nine waves of data from the Health and Retirement Survey, we simultaneously modeled the longitudinal associations between engaging in formal volunteering and changes in cognitive functioning using multilevel models. Results Formal volunteering was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning over time, especially with aspects of cognitive functioning related to working memory and processing. This association was stronger for women than it was for men, and for those with below average levels of education. The positive association between formal volunteering and cognitive functioning weakened over time when cognitive functioning was conceptualized as memory, but strengthened over time when conceptualized as working memory and processing. Discussion Volunteering is a productive activity that is beneficial not just to society, but to volunteers’ levels of cognitive functioning in older age. For women and those with lower levels of education, formal volunteering appears particularly beneficial to working memory and processing.;,citation_author=Christine M Proulx;,citation_author=Angela L Curl;,citation_author=Ashley E Ermer;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/geronb/gbx110;,citation_issn=10795014;,citation_volume=73;,citation_journal_title=Journals Gerontol. - Ser.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dopaminergic effects on simple and choice reaction time performance in Parkinson’s disease;,citation_abstract=The present study examined whether premovement central neural processing in Parkinson’s disease was related to functional motor disability and plasma L-dopa concentration. Reaction time (RT) performance in simple and choice RT tasks was assessed while plasma L-dopa levels were controlled by continuous IV L-dopa infusion in five parkinsonian patients. Five age-matched controls performed the same RT tasks for comparison. Simple RT for the patients was longer than the normal control RT at all infusion levels (p = 5 0.005). However, choice RT was normal when the patients were “on,” but became prolonged as plasma L-dopa levels decreased (p = 5 0.01). The results show that there are abnormalities of premovement central neural processing in Parkinson’s disease, and that simple and choice RTs are differentially affected by L-dopa replacement. This suggests that different neural mechanisms may be involved in the processing of these tasks. © 1988 American Academy of Neurology.;,citation_author=S. L. Pullman;,citation_author=R. L.

Path analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results and questionnaires about ADHD traits and traffic crashes over the past decade revealed significant correlations of ADHD traits with different brain regions relevant to different cognitive functions. The left precuneus responsible for visuospatial cognition was the sole region correlated with all ADHD trait categories, suggesting it plays an important role in understanding driving safety and traffic crashes. For the first time, a strong relationship was found among regional GMVs, ADHD traits, and real-life traffic crashes. These insights into the complex interplay may inform the development of an effective intervention with MRI examination to prevent traffic crashes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Methods for meta-analysis of multiple traits using GWAS summary statistics;,citation_abstract=Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for complex diseases have focused primarily on single-trait analyses for disease status and disease-related quantitative traits. For example, GWAS on risk factors for coronary artery disease analyze genetic associations of plasma lipids such as total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs) separately. However, traits are often correlated and a joint analysis may yield increased statistical power for association over multiple univariate analyses. Recently several multivariate methods have been proposed that require individual-level data. Here, we develop metaUSAT (where USAT is unified score-based association test), a novel unified association test of a single genetic variant with multiple traits that uses only summary statistics from existing GWAS. Although the existing methods either perform well when most correlated traits are affected by the genetic variant in the same direction or are powerful when only a few of the correlated traits are associated, metaUSAT is designed to be robust to the association structure of correlated traits. metaUSAT does not require individual-level data and can test genetic associations of categorical and/or continuous traits. One can also use metaUSAT to analyze a single trait over multiple studies, appropriately accounting for overlapping samples, if any. metaUSAT provides an approximate asymptotic P-value for association and is computationally efficient for implementation at a genome-wide level. Simulation experiments show that metaUSAT maintains proper type-I error at low error levels. It has similar and sometimes greater power to detect association across a wide array of scenarios compared to existing methods, which are usually powerful for some specific association scenarios only. When applied to plasma lipids summary data from the METSIM and the T2D-GENES studies, metaUSAT detected genome-wide significant loci beyond the ones identified by univariate analyses. Evidence from larger studies suggest that the variants additionally detected by our test are, indeed, associated with lipid levels in humans. In summary, metaUSAT can provide novel insights into the genetic architecture of a common disease or traits.;,citation_author=Debashree Ray;,citation_author=Michael Boehnke;,citation_publication_date=2018-03;,citation_cover_date=2018-03;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/gepi.22105;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1002/gepi.22105;,citation_issn=07410395;,citation_volume=42;,citation_journal_title=Genet.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Complex span and n-back measures of working memory: A meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Working memory is a construct of primary relevance to many areas of psychology. Two types of tasks have been used to measure working memory, primarily in different research areas: Complex span tasks are commonly used in behavioral studies in the cognitive and individual-differences literature, whereas n-back tasks have been used more frequently in cognitive neuroscience studies investigating the neural underpinnings of working memory. Despite both categories of tasks being labeled as &amp;amp;amp;quot;working memory&amp;quot; measures , previous empirical studies have provided mixed evidence regarding the shared amount of overlapping processes between complex span and n-back tasks. The present meta-analysis showed that the complex span and n-back tasks are weakly correlated, although significant heterogeneity across studies was observed. A follow-up analysis of unpublished data indicated that the sample composition affects the relationship between the complex span and n-back tasks, following the law of diminishing returns. Finally, a separate meta-analysis indicated that the simple span and n-back tasks are correlated to the same extent as are the complex span and n-back tasks. The present findings indicate that the complex span and n-back tasks cannot be used interchangeably as working memory measures in research applications.;,citation_author=Thomas S.

The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. Brain phenotypes showing environmental influence may help clarify unexplained associations between urban exposure and psychiatric risk. Heritable prefrontal fMRI activation during working memory (WM) is such a phenotype. We hypothesized that urban upbringing (childhood urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with dopamine genes that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has been hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress. WM-related prefrontal function was tested for main effects of urbanicity, main effects of three dopamine genes—catechol-O-methyltrans-ferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)—and, importantly, dopamine gene-by-urbanicity interactions. For COMT, three independent human samples were recruited (total n = 487). We also studied 253 subjects genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation during the N-back WM task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity, dopamine genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent variables. Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found. Individuals raised in an urban environment showed altered prefrontal activation relative to those raised in rural or town settings. For each gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity interactions were shown in prefrontal cortex–COMT replicated twice in two independent samples. An urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and interacted with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships. Gene-environment interactions between multiple dopamine genes and urban upbringing suggest that neural effects of developmental environmental exposure could mediate, at least partially, increased risk for psychiatric illness in urban environments via dopamine genes expressed into adulthood.;,citation_author=Jessica L.

The long-term cognitive and socioeconomic consequences of lead exposure are uncertain. Objective To test the hypothesis that childhood lead exposure is associated with cognitive function and socioeconomic status in adulthood and with changes in IQ and socioeconomic mobility between childhood and midlife. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective cohort study based on a population-representative 1972-1973 birth cohort from New Zealand; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years (until December 2012). Exposures Childhood lead exposure ascertained as blood lead levels measured at age 11 years. High blood lead levels were observed among children from all socioeconomic status levels in this cohort. Main Outcomes and Measures The IQ (primary outcome) and indexes of Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed (secondary outcomes) were assessed at age 38 years using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–IV (WAIS-IV; IQ range, 40-160). Socioeconomic status (primary outcome) was assessed at age 38 years using the New Zealand Socioeconomic Index-2006 (NZSEI-06; range, 10 [lowest]-90 [highest]). Results Of 1037 original participants, 1007 were alive at age 38 years, of whom 565 (56%) had been lead tested at age 11 years (54% male; 93% white). Mean (SD) blood lead level at age 11 years was 10.99 (4.63) µg/dL. Among blood-tested participants included at age 38 years, mean WAIS-IV score was 101.16 (14.82) and mean NZSEI-06 score was 49.75 (17.12). After adjusting for maternal IQ, childhood IQ, and childhood socioeconomic status, each 5-µg/dL higher level of blood lead in childhood was associated with a 1.61-point lower score (95% CI, −2.48 to −0.74) in adult IQ, a 2.07-point lower score (95% CI, −3.14 to −1.01) in perceptual reasoning, and a 1.26-point lower score (95% CI, −2.38 to −0.14) in working memory. Associations of childhood blood lead level with deficits in verbal comprehension and processing speed were not statistically significant. After adjusting for confounders, each 5-µg/dL higher level of blood lead in childhood was associated with a 1.79-unit lower score (95% CI, −3.17 to −0.40) in socioeconomic status. An association between greater blood lead levels and a decline in IQ and socioeconomic status from childhood to adulthood was observed with 40% of the association with downward mobility mediated by cognitive decline from childhood. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort born in New Zealand in 1972-1973, childhood lead exposure was associated with lower cognitive function and socioeconomic status at age 38 years and with declines in IQ and with downward social mobility.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=[The treatment of oppositional defiant disorder];,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) affects between 2 and 16% of children. It is a problem that sometimes has a very important effect on the whole family structure. Dealing with the problem in an inappropriate way, or simply interpreting it wrongly, entails a high risk of developing a conduct disorder in adolescence. DEVELOPMENT: This paper reviews the concept of ODD and of conduct disorder, and highlights the theoretical foundations that underlie two types of behavioural intervention, namely, the behaviourist model and the cognitive model. Two programmes, each based on one of the two theoretical models, are described. The different pharmacological options that can facilitate the therapeutic process are also outlined. CONCLUSIONS: Emphasis is placed on a therapeutic approach to ODD through psychological interventions based on guidelines designed to orientate the family and the school. This intervention cannot be founded on a general educational model, but rather it has to rest on knowledge of the dysfunctional cognitive characteristics of each child. In severe cases, the intervention must be complemented with the use of medication.;,citation_author=E. Rigau-Ratera;,citation_author=C. García-Nonell;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond anger control: Difficulty attending to emotions also predicts aggression in offenders.;,citation_abstract=Objective: The influence of anger experience, expression, and control on aggressive behavior has been the focus of much theoretical and empirical attention. The influence of other emotions and emotional processing facets on aggression has received less consideration. This study sought to determine whether failing to attend to upsetting emotions, including anger, is associated with aggression, beyond the effects of poor anger control. Method: Participants (n = 64) were criminal offenders who were mandated to attend Community Corrections Offices across Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed measures of anger experience, expression and control, attention to emotions, past aggression, and verbal intelligence. Results: Results indicate that participants reporting difficulty attending to their emotions had more extensive histories of aggression than those who did not report such difficulties. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for trait anger and the ability to control the outward expression of anger. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of current approaches to violent offender treatment. In particular, it is recommended that intervention programs should seek to emphasize the importance of controlling aggressive behavior in the face of anger, while attending to (rather than avoiding or suppressing) the anger experience itself.

Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modelling neural correlates of working memory: A coordinate-based meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Working memory subsumes the capability to memorize, retrieve and utilize information for a limited period of time which is essential to many human behaviours. Moreover, impairments of working memory functions may be found in nearly all neurological and psychiatric diseases. To examine what brain regions are commonly and differently active during various working memory tasks, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis over 189 fMRI experiments on healthy subjects. The main effect yielded a widespread bilateral fronto-parietal network. Further meta-analyses revealed that several regions were sensitive to specific task components, e.g. Broca’s region was selectively active during verbal tasks or ventral and dorsal premotor cortex were preferentially involved in memory for object identity and location, respectively. Moreover, the lateral prefrontal cortex showed a division in a rostral and a caudal part based on differential involvement in task set and load effects. Nevertheless, a consistent but more restricted &amp;amp;amp;quot;core&amp;quot; network emerged from conjunctions across analyses of specific task designs and contrasts. This &quot;core&quot; network appears to comprise the quintessence of regions, which are necessary during working memory tasks. It may be argued that the core regions form a distributed executive network with potentially generalized functions for focussing on competing representations in the brain. The present study demonstrates that meta-analyses are a powerful tool to integrate the data of functional imaging studies on a (broader) psychological construct, probing the consistency across various paradigms as well as the differential effects of different experimental implementations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Interventions targeting working memory in 4–11 year olds within their everyday contexts: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=It has been suggested that diverse interventions applied within children’s everyday contexts have the potential to improve working memory (WM) and produce transfer to real-world skills but little is known about the effectiveness of these approaches. This review aims to examine systematically the effectiveness of non-computerised interventions with 4–11 year olds to identify: (i) their effects on WM; (ii) whether benefits extend to near- and far-transfer measures; (iii) if gains are sustained over time; (iv) the active ingredients; and (v) the optimum dosage. Searches were conducted across 12 electronic databases using consistent keywords. Papers were screened by title and abstract (n = 6212) and judged against pre-defined eligibility criteria (n = 63). Eighteen papers were included in the review. They used a range of non-computerised WM intervention approaches that included: (i) adapting the environment to reduce WM loads; (ii) direct WM training with and without strategy instruction; and (iii) training skills which may indirectly impact on WM (physical activity, phonological awareness, fantastical play and inhibition). Both direct training on WM tasks and practicing certain skills that may impact indirectly on WM (physical activity, fantastical play and inhibition) produced improvements on WM tasks, with some benefits for near-transfer activities. The common ingredient across effective interventions was the executive-loaded nature of the trained task i.e., training on a task that taps into attentional and processing resources under executive control and not just the storage of information. Few studies reported dosage effects, measured far-transfer effects (n = 4), or tested the durability of gains over time (n = 4). The lack of a clear theoretical framework in many of the included studies resulted in ambiguous predictions about training and transfer effects, and inadequate use of outcome measures. Methodological issues also constrain the strength of the evidence, including: small samples sizes; an absence of blinding of participant and outcome assessors; and lack of active control groups. Further well-designed and controlled studies with clear theoretical underpinnings are required to expand and enhance the evidence base. The heterogeneity of the interventions and of the study designs (randomised and non-randomised) in the included papers limited the synthesis of evidence across studies. However, this diversity enabled the identification of key ingredients, notably the training of executive-loaded WM tasks, which can help inform novel approaches to WM intervention in everyday contexts.;,citation_author=Anita Rowe;,citation_author=Jill Titterington;,citation_author=Joni Holmes;,citation_author=Lucy Henry;,citation_author=Laurence Taggart;,citation_publication_date=2019-06;,citation_cover_date=2019-06;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0273229718300789;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.dr.2019.02.001;,citation_issn=02732297;,citation_volume=52;,citation_journal_title=Dev.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of mental fatigue on speed–accuracy trade-off;,citation_abstract=The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mental fatigue on the duration of actual and imagined goal-directed arm movements involving speed-accuracy trade-off. Ten participants performed actual and imagined point-to-point arm movements as accurately and as fast as possible, before and after a 90-min sustained cognitive task inducing mental fatigue, and before and after viewing a neutral control task (documentary movie) that did not induce mental fatigue. Target width and center-to-center target distance were varied, resulting in five different indexes of difficulty. Prior to mental fatigue, actual and imagined movement duration increased with the difficulty of the task, as predicted by Fitts’ law. Mental fatigue task induced a 4.1. ±. 0.7% increase in actual movement duration and a 9.6. ±. 1.1% increase in imagined movement duration, independently of the index of difficulty. The trial-by-trial evolution of actual and imagined movement duration remained stable with mental fatigue. The control task did not induce any change in actual and imagined movement duration. The results suggested that movement was slowed in the presence of mental fatigue, maybe due to proactive changes occurring during the preparatory state of the movement, to preserve task success.;,citation_author=V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ComPaSS-GWAS: A method to reduce type I error in genome-wide association studies when replication data are not available;,citation_abstract=In this paper, we have proposed a novel robotic knee device with a five-bar linkage to allow low impedance voluntary knee motions within a specified rotation range during swing phase and to assist knee extension motions during stance phase after reaching the boundary of the rotation range. The proposed device can provide free knee motions through the five-bar linkage with 2-DOF (degree of freedom) actuations by a patient’s shank and a linear actuator, and can assist knee extension at any controlled knee angle during weight bearing by a geared five-bar linkage with 1-DOF actuation of the linear actuator. The kinematic transition between two modes can be implemented by contact mechanism of a circular structure (knee joint) and a linear link (patella), and the resultant knee rotation range can be determined by the linear actuator. A weight optimization scheme with a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) is performed to increase portability of the proposed device and minimize the side- effects of increased link numbers as compared to existing four-bar mechanisms. The cost function is composed of sums of normalized total link lengths and normalized motor powers. The optimization results show that the total link length and motor power were reduced to 47% and 43% respectively, as compared to initial design. The proposed robotic knee device can provide a new rehabilitation mode for a stroke patient to allow safe and self-motivated overground walking with minimum concern of falling down.;,citation_author=Jeremy A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Construct validity of the Trail Making Test: Role of task-switching, working memory, inhibition/interference control, and visuomotor abilities;,citation_abstract=The aim of this study was to clarify which cognitive mechanisms underlie Trail Making Test (TMT) direct and derived scores. A comprehensive review of the literature on the topic was carried out to clarify which cognitive factors had been related to TMT performance. Following the review, we explored the relative contribution from working memory, inhibition/interference control, task-switching ability, and visuomotor speed to TMT performance. Forty-one healthy old subjects participated in the study and performed a battery of neuropsychological tests including the TMT, the Digit Symbol subtest [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Third Version) (WAIS-III)], a Finger Tapping Test, the Digits Forward and Backward subtests (WAIS-III), Stroop Test, and a task-switching paradigm inspired in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Correlation and regression analyses were used in order to clarify the joint and unique contributions from different cognitive factors to the prediction of TMT scores. The results suggest that TMT-A requires mainly visuoperceptual abilities, TMT-B reflects primarily working memory and secondarily task-switching ability, while B-A minimizes visuoperceptual and working memory demands, providing a relatively pure indicator of executive control abilities.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dopamine firing plays a dual role in coding reward prediction errors and signaling motivation in a working memory task;,citation_abstract=Significance Recent studies have confirmed the role of dopamine firing in reward prediction error, even under perceptual uncertainty. However, little is known about dopamine behavior during the use of working memory or its role in motivation to work for reward. Here, we investigated these issues in a discrimination task. Fast dopamine responses reflected a perceptual bias while remaining consistent with the reward prediction error hypothesis. When the bias increased task difficulty, motivation positively correlated with both performance and dopamine activity. In addition , dopamine slowly ramped up in a motivation-dependent way during the working memory period. Characterizing dopamine neurons’ activity during tasks in which motivation influences behavior could importantly advance our knowledge of dopamine roles in effortful control. , Little is known about how dopamine (DA) neuron firing rates behave in cognitively demanding decision-making tasks. Here, we investigated midbrain DA activity in monkeys performing a discrimination task in which the animal had to use working memory (WM) to report which of two sequentially applied vibrotactile stimuli had the higher frequency. We found that perception was altered by an internal bias, likely generated by deterioration of the representation of the first frequency during the WM period. This bias greatly controlled the DA phasic response during the two stimulation periods, confirming that DA reward prediction errors reflected stimulus perception. In contrast, tonic dopamine activity during WM was not affected by the bias and did not encode the stored frequency. More interestingly, both delay-period activity and phasic responses before the second stimulus negatively correlated with reaction times of the animals after the trial start cue and thus represented motivated behavior on a trial-by-trial basis. During WM, this motivation signal underwent a ramp-like increase. At the same time, motivation positively correlated with accuracy, especially in difficult trials, probably by decreasing the effect of the bias. Overall, our results indicate that DA activity, in addition to encoding reward prediction errors, could at the same time be involved in motivation and WM. In particular, the ramping activity during the delay period suggests a possible DA role in stabilizing sustained cortical activity, hypothetically by increasing the gain communicated to prefrontal neurons in a motivation-dependent way.;,citation_author=Stefania Sarno;,citation_author=Manuel Beirán;,citation_author=Joan Falcó-Roget;,citation_author=Gabriel Diaz-deLeon;,citation_author=Román Rossi-Pool;,citation_author=Ranulfo Romo;,citation_author=Néstor Parga;,citation_publication_date=2022-01-11;,citation_cover_date=2022-01-11;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2113311119;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.2113311119;,citation_issn=0027-8424, 1091-6490;,citation_volume=119;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

Intelligence is highly heritable1and a major determinant of human health and well-being2. Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in intelligence3-7, but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present a large-scale genetic association study of intelligence (n = 269,867), identifying 205 associated genomic loci (190 new) and 1,016 genes (939 new) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene set analyses implicate pathways related to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer’s disease and ADHD and bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically related neurological and psychiatric disorders.;,citation_author=Jeanne E.

This study sought to evaluate the extent to which medical consumers of neuropsychological assessments believed that results/findings were not clearly communicated. In addition, preference data for a variety of qualitative descriptors commonly used to communicate normative neuropsychological test scores were obtained.Preference data were obtained for five qualitative descriptor systems as part of a larger 36-item internet-based survey of physician satisfaction with neuropsychological services. A new qualitative descriptor system termed the Simplified Qualitative Classification System (Q-Simple) was proposed to reduce the potential for communication errors using seven terms: very superior, superior, high average, average, low average, borderline, and abnormal/impaired. A non-random convenience sample of 605 clinicians identified from four United States academic medical centers from January 1, 2015 through January 7, 2016 were invited to participate.A total of 182 surveys were completed. A minority of clinicians (12.5 %) indicated that neuropsychological study results were not clearly communicated.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards reporting standards for neuropsychological study results: A  proposal to minimize communication errors with standardized qualitative descriptors for normalized test scores;,citation_abstract=Objective: Rapid, clear and efficient communication of neuropsychological results is essential to benefit patient care. Errors in communication are a lead cause of medical errors; nevertheless, there remains a lack of consistency in how neuropsychological scores are communicated. A major limitation in the communication of neuropsychological results is the inconsistent use of qualitative descriptors for standardized test scores and the use of vague terminology. Patients and methods: PubMed search from 1 Jan 2007 to 1 Aug 2016 to identify guidelines or consensus statements for the description and reporting of qualitative terms to communicate neuropsychological test scores was conducted. The review found the use of confusing and overlapping terms to describe various ranges of percentile standardized test scores. Results: In response, we propose a simplified set of qualitative descriptors for normalized test scores (Q-Simple) as a means to reduce errors in communicating test results. The Q-Simple qualitative terms are: “very superior”, “superior”, “high average”, “average”, “low average”, “borderline” and “abnormal/impaired”. A case example illustrates the proposed Q-Simple qualitative classification system to communicate neuropsychological results for neurosurgical planning. Conclusions: The Q-Simple qualitative descriptor system is aimed as a means to improve and standardize communication of standardized neuropsychological test scores. Research are needed to further evaluate neuropsychological communication errors. Conveying the clinical implications of neuropsychological results in a manner that minimizes risk for communication errors is a quintessential component of evidence-based practice.;,citation_author=Mike R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural basis of somatosensory target detection independent of uncertainty, relevance, and reports;,citation_abstract=Research on somatosensory awareness has yielded highly diverse findings with putative neural correlates ranging from activity within somatosensory cortex to activation of widely distributed frontoparietal networks. Divergent results from previous studies may reside in cognitive processes that often coincide with stimulus awareness in experimental settings. To scrutinise the specific relevance of regions implied in the target detection network, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 27) on a novel somatosensory detection task that explicitly controls for stimulus uncertainty, behavioural relevance, overt reports, and motor responses. Using Bayesian Model Selection, we show that responses reflecting target detection are restricted to secondary somatosensory cortex, whereas activity in insular, cingulate, and motor regions is best explained in terms of stimulus uncertainty and overt reports. Our results emphasise the role of sensory-specific cortex for the emergence of perceptual awareness and dissect the contribution of the frontoparietal network to classical detection tasks.;,citation_author=Pia Schröder;,citation_author=Timo Torsten Schmidt;,citation_author=Felix Blankenburg;,citation_publication_date=2019-03-29;,citation_cover_date=2019-03-29;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/43410;,citation_doi=10.7554/eLife.43410;,citation_issn=2050-084X;,citation_volume=8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=eLife;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Common cortical architectures for phonological working memory identified in individual brains;,citation_abstract=Phonological working memory is the capacity to briefly maintain and recall representations of sounds important for speech and language and is believed to be critical for language and reading acquisition. Whether phonological working memory is supported by fronto-parietal brain regions associated with short-term memory storage or perisylvian brain structures implicated in speech perception and production is unclear, perhaps due to variability in stimuli, task demands, and individuals. We used fMRI to assess neurophysiological responses while individuals performed two tasks with closely matched stimuli but divergent task demands—nonword repetition and nonword discrimination—at two levels of phonological working memory load. Using analyses designed to address intersubject variability, we found significant neural responses to the critical contrast of high vs. low phonological working memory load in both tasks in a set of regions closely resembling those involved in speech perception and production. Moreover, within those regions, the voxel-wise patterns of load-related activation were highly correlated between the two tasks. These results suggest that brain regions in the temporal and frontal lobes encapsulate the core neurocomputational components of phonological working memory; an architecture that becomes increasingly evident as neural responses are examined in successively finer-grained detail in individual participants.;,citation_author=Terri L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Auditory working memory impairments in individuals at familial high risk for schizophrenia.;,citation_abstract=Objectives: The search for predictors of schizophrenia has accelerated with a growing focus on early intervention and prevention of psychotic illness. Studying nonpsychotic relatives of individuals with schizophrenia enables identification of markers of vulnerability for the illness independent of confounds associated with psychosis. The goal of these studies was to develop new auditory continuous performance tests (ACPTs) and evaluate their effects in individuals with schizophrenia and their relatives. Methods: We carried out two studies of auditory vigilance with tasks involving working memory (WM) and interference control with increasing levels of cognitive load to discern the information-processing vulnerabilities in a sample of schizophrenia patients, and two samples of nonpsychotic relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and controls. Study 1 assessed adults (mean age = 41), and Study 2 assessed teenagers and young adults age 13-25 (M = 19). Results: Patients with schizophrenia were impaired on all five versions of the ACPTs, whereas relatives were impaired only on WM tasks, particularly the two interference tasks that maximize cognitive load. Across all groups, the interference tasks were more difficult to perform than the other tasks. Schizophrenia patients performed worse than relatives, who performed worse than controls. For patients, the effect sizes were large (Cohen’s d = 1.5), whereas for relatives they were moderate (d=∼0.40-0.50). There was no age by group interaction in the relatives-control comparison except for participants\textless31 years of age.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is working memory training effective?;,citation_abstract=Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that strongly relates to a person’s ability to reason with novel information and direct attention to goal-relevant information. Due to the central role that WM plays in general cognition, it has become the focus of a rapidly growing training literature that seeks to affect broad cognitive change through prolonged training on WM tasks. Recent work has suggested that the effects of WM training extend to general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and reductions in symptoms of ADHD. We present a theoretically motivated perspective of WM and subsequently review the WM training literature in light of several concerns. These include (a) the tendency for researchers to define change to abilities using single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of valid WM tasks, (c) no-contact control groups, and (d) subjective measurement of change. The literature review highlights several findings that warrant further research but ultimately concludes that there is a need to directly demonstrate that WM capacity increases in response to training. Specifically, we argue that transfer of training to WM must be demonstrated using a wider variety of tasks, thus eliminating the possibility that results can be explained by task specific learning. Additionally, we express concern that many of the most promising results (e.g., increased intelligence) cannot be readily attributed to changes in WM capacity. Thus, a critical goal for future research is to uncover the mechanisms that lead to transfer of training.;,citation_author=Zach Shipstead;,citation_author=Thomas S. Redick;,citation_author=Randall W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for adolescents with  ADHD: An updated systematic review of the literature;,citation_abstract=Smith, Waschbusch, Willoughby, and Evans (2000) reviewed a small treatment literature on ADHD in adolescents and concluded that methylphenidate stimulant medication was a well-established treatment and behavior therapy (BT) demonstrated preliminary efficacy. This review extends and updates the findings of the prior one based on the previous 15 years of research. Studies published since 1999 were identified and coded using standard criteria and effect sizes were calculated where appropriate. Highlights of the last 15 years of research include an expansion of pharmacological treatment options and developmentally appropriate psychosocial treatment packages for adolescents with ADHD. Additionally, nonstimulant medications (e.g., atomoxetine) are now approved for the treatment of ADHD in adolescence. The review concludes that medication and BT produce a similar range of therapeutic effects on the symptoms of adolescents with ADHD. However, results suggest that BT may produce greater overall benefits on measures of impairment. There was no evidence that cognitive enhancement trainings, such as working memory training or neurofeedback improved the functioning of adolescents with ADHD. Whether to use medication, BT, or their combination to treat an adolescent with ADHD is complicated and we provide evidence-informed guidelines for treatment selection.

The field continues to refine diagnostic standards for ADHD in adults, complicated by the disorder’s heterogeneous presentation, subjective symptoms, and overlap with other disorders. Two key diagnostic questions are from whom to collect diagnostic information and which symptoms should be contained on an adult diagnostic checklist. Using a trifactor model, Martel et al. examine these questions in a sample of adults with and without self-identified ADHD symptoms. In this response, we highlight the importance of their finding that self and informant symptom reports differ in a sample of adults who acknowledge ADHD symptoms. We also review issues that continue to face the field related to model specification, evaluating symptom utility, and sample composition, discussing how these issues influence conclusions that may be drawn from Martel et al. and similar investigations.

To show that RT has increased, the RTs obtained by young adults in 14 studies published from 1941 on were compared with the RTs obtained by young adults in a study conducted by Galton in the late 1800s. With one exception, the newer studies obtained RTs longer than those obtained by Galton. The possibility that these differences in results are due to faulty timing instruments is considered but deemed unlikely. Of several possible causes for longer RTs, two are regarded as tenable: that RT has been increased by the buildup of neurotoxins in the environment and by the increasing numbers of people in less than robust health who have survived into adulthood. The importance of standardizing tests of RT in order to enable more refined analyses of secular trends in RT is emphasized. © 2010 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.;,citation_author=Irwin Silverman;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.1.0039;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.1.0039;,citation_issn=00029556;,citation_volume=123;,citation_journal_title=The American Journal of Psychology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive functioning in the schizophrenia prodrome.;,citation_abstract=In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in cognitive alterations during the early course of schizophrenia. From a clinical perspective, a better understanding of cognitive functioning in putative at-risk states for schizophrenia is essential for developing optimal early intervention models. Two approaches have more recently been combined to assess the entire course of the initial schizophrenia prodrome: the predictive &amp;amp;amp;quot;basic symptom at-risk&amp;quot; (BS) and the ultra high-risk (UHR) criteria. Basic symptoms are considered to be present during the entire disease progression, including the initial prodrome, while the onset of symptoms captured by the UHR criteria expresses further disease progression toward frank psychosis. The present study investigated the cognitive functioning in 93 subjects who met either BS or UHR criteria and thus were assumed to be at different points on the putative trajectory to psychosis. We compared them with 43 patients with a first episode of psychosis and to 49 help-seeking patient controls. All groups performed significantly below normative values. Both at-risk groups performed at intermediate levels between the first-episode (FE) group and normative values. The UHR group demonstrated intermediate performance between the FE and BS groups. Overall, auditory working memory, verbal fluency/processing speed, and declarative verbal memory were impaired the most. Our results suggest that cognitive impairments may still be modest in the early stages of the initial schizophrenia prodrome and thus support current efforts to intervene in the early course of impending schizophrenia because early intervention may prevent or delay the onset of frank psychosis and thus prevent further cognitive damage.;,citation_author=Andor E Simon;,citation_author=Katja Cattapan-Ludewig;,citation_author=Solange Zmilacher;,citation_author=Dima Arbach;,citation_author=Kerstin Gruber;,citation_author=Diane N Dvorsky;,citation_author=Binia Roth;,citation_author=Emanuel Isler;,citation_author=Alexander Zimmer;,citation_author=Daniel Umbricht;,citation_publication_date=2007-03;,citation_cover_date=2007-03;,citation_year=2007;,citation_fulltext_html_url=

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of genetic loci jointly influencing schizophrenia risk and the cognitive traits of verbal-numerical reasoning, reaction time, and general cognitive function;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: Schizophrenia is associated with widespread cognitive impairments. Although cognitive deficits are one of the factors most strongly associated with functional outcome in schizophrenia, current treatment strategies largely fail to ameliorate these impairments. To develop more efficient treatment strategies in patients with schizophrenia, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these cognitive deficits is needed. Accumulating evidence indicates that genetic risk of schizophrenia may contribute to cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To identify genomic regions jointly influencing schizophrenia and the cognitive domains of reaction time and verbal-numerical reasoning, as well as general cognitive function, a phenotype that captures the shared variation in performance across cognitive domains. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Combining data from genome-wide association studies from multiple phenotypes using conditional false discovery rate analysis provides increased power to discover genetic variants and could elucidate shared molecular genetic mechanisms. Data from the following genome-wide association studies, published from July 24, 2014, to January 17, 2017, were combined: schizophrenia in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium cohort (n = 79 757 [cases, 34 486; controls, 45 271]); verbal-numerical reasoning (n = 36 035) and reaction time (n = 111 483) in the UK Biobank cohort; and general cognitive function in CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) (n = 53 949) and COGENT (Cognitive Genomics Consortium) (n = 27 888). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genetic loci identified by conditional false discovery rate analysis. Brain messenger RNA expression and brain expression quantitative trait locus functionality were determined. RESULTS: Among the participants in the genome-wide association studies, 21 loci jointly influencing schizophrenia and cognitive traits were identified: 2 loci shared between schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning, 6 loci shared between schizophrenia and reaction time, and 14 loci shared between schizophrenia and general cognitive function. One locus was shared between schizophrenia and 2 cognitive traits and represented the strongest shared signal detected (nearest gene TCF20; chromosome 22q13.2), and was shared between schizophrenia (z score, 5.01; P = 5.53 × 10−7), general cognitive function (z score, –4.43; P = 9.42 × 10−6), and verbal-numerical reasoning (z score, –5.43; P = 5.64 × 10−8). For 18 loci, schizophrenia risk alleles were associated with poorer cognitive performance. The implicated genes are expressed in the developmental and adult human brain. Replicable expression quantitative trait locus functionality was identified for 4 loci in the adult human brain. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The discovered loci improve the understanding of the common genetic basis underlying schizophrenia and cognitive function, suggesting novel molecular genetic mechanisms.;,citation_author=Olav B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How can genetics help understand the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and schizophrenia?;,citation_abstract=Despite the consistent finding that cognitive dysfunction is a core characteristic of schizophrenia (SCZ), little is known about the underlying pathophysiology. Recent progress in human genetics, driven by large genome-wide association studies (GWAS), has provided new data about the genetic architecture of complex human traits, including cognition and SCZ. Novel analytical tools have provided unprecedented opportunities to leverage the large amount of information from GWAS. Here we review the latest findings related to genetic architecture and risk genes of SCZ and cognitive functions, and recent findings of overlapping genetic factors. The recent GWAS of SCZ implicate over 100 risk gene loci, each with a small effect. A similar genetic architecture seems to be present in cognitive domains, suggesting that these phenotypes are highly polygenic. Further, GWAS have revealed more than 20 gene loci associated with cognitive traits, including intelligence, general cognition (g-factor), reaction time and verbal-numerical reasoning. Several gene loci have been implicated in educational attainment, a proxy measure of cognitive function. Recently, overlapping gene loci were found between education and SCZ, and between SCZ and cognitive traits, suggesting common genetic risk between SCZ and cognitive dysfunction. Mathematical modeling of GWAS of cognition and SCZ indicate that only a fraction of the heritability is identified. The evidence suggests a polygenic architecture for SCZ and cognitive functions, and a large degree of shared genetic risk. This indicates novel molecular genetic mechanisms and strengthens the notion that SCZ is more likely a part of the normal distribution and not a separate entity.;,citation_author=Olav B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The polygenic architecture of schizophrenia - rethinking pathogenesis and nosology;,citation_abstract=Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with considerable morbidity and mortality. Although the past two decades have seen limited improvement in the treatment of schizophrenia, research into the genetic causes of this condition has made important advances that offer new insights into the aetiology of schizophrenia. This Review summarizes the evidence for a polygenic architecture of schizophrenia that involves a large number of risk alleles across the whole range of population frequencies. These genetic risk loci implicate biological processes related to neurodevelopment, neuronal excitability, synaptic function and the immune system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Mathematical models also suggest a substantial overlap between schizophrenia and psychiatric, behavioural and cognitive traits, a situation that has implications for understanding its clinical epidemiology, psychiatric nosology and pathobiology. Looking ahead, further genetic discoveries are expected to lead to clinically relevant predictive approaches for identifying high-risk individuals, improved diagnostic accuracy, increased yield from drug development programmes and improved stratification strategies to address the heterogeneous disease course and treatment responses observed among affected patients.;,citation_author=Olav B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal Models of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder : From Common Simple Deficits to Multiple Developmental Pathways ;,citation_abstract=Until recently, causal models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have tended to focus on the role of common, simple, core deficits. One such model highlights the role of executive dysfunction due to deficient inhibitory control resulting from disturbances in the frontodorsal striatal circuit and associated mesocortical dopaminergic branches. An alternative model presents ADHD as resulting from impaired signaling of delayed rewards arising from disturbances in motivational processes, involving frontoventral striatal reward circuits and mesolimbic branches terminating in the ventral striatum, particularly the nucleus accumbens. In the present article, these models are elaborated in two ways. First, they are each placed within their developmental context by consideration of the role of person × environment correlation and interaction and individual adaptation to developmental constraint. Second, their relationship to one another is reviewed in the light of recent data suggesting that delay aversion and executive functions might each make distinctive contributions to the development of the disorder. This provides an impetus for theoretical models built around the idea of multiple neurodevelopmental pathways. The possibility of neuropathologic heterogeneity in ADHD is likely to have important implications for the clinical management of the condition, potentially impacting on both diagnostic strategies and treatment options.;,citation_author=Edmund J.

Data analysis was performed from August 6, 2015, to December 11, 2015. Of a screened population of 4656 children, 730 met the screening criteria indicating a high level of disruptive behavioral problems. A total of 464 parents of 4-year-old children were randomized into the Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) intervention group (n =  232) or an education control (EC) group (n = 232).The SFSW intervention, an 11-session Internet-assisted parent training program that included weekly telephone coaching.Child Behavior Checklist version for preschool children (CBCL/1.5-5) externalizing scale (primary outcome), other CBCL/1.5-5 scales and subscores, Parenting Scale, Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits, and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. All data were analyzed by intention to treat and per protocol. The assessments were made before randomization and 6 and 12 months after randomization.Of the children randomized, 287 (61.9%) were male and 79 (17.1%) lived in other than a family with 2 biological parents.

We apply SumHer to results from 24 large-scale association studies (average sample size 121,000) using our recommended heritability model. We show that these studies tended to substantially over-correct for confounding, and as a result the number of genome-wide significant loci was under-reported by about a quarter. We also estimate enrichments for 24 categories of SNPs defined by functional annotations. A previous study using LDSC reported that conserved regions were 13-fold enriched, and found a further six categories with above threefold enrichment.

Prominent models posit that increasing the number of remembered items decreases the spiking activity dedicated to each item via mutual inhibition, which irreparably degrades the fidelity of each item’s representation. We tested these models by determining if degraded memory representations could be recovered following a post-cue indicating which of several items in spatial WM would be recalled. Using an fMRI-based image reconstruction technique, we identified impaired behavioral performance and degraded mnemonic representations with elevated memory load. However, in several cortical regions, degraded mnemonic representations recovered substantially following a post-cue, and this recovery tracked behavioral performance. These results challenge pure spike-based models of WM and suggest that remembered items are additionally encoded within latent or hidden neural codes that can help reinvigorate active WM representations.;,citation_author=Thomas C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Are attentional control resources reduced by worry in generalized anxiety disorder?;,citation_abstract=This is the first study to examine attentional control capacities in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is characterized by uncontrollable worry. Individuals diagnosed with GAD and healthy participants (HPs) performed a random key-pressing task while thinking about a worrisome or a positive future event, to assess the extent to which attentional control resources are used by worry. Attentional control was also assessed when participants were not instructed to think about a specific topic using the N-back task, which varies in task difficulty, and therefore is sensitive to subtle differences in ability to handle increasing demands on attentional control within the same paradigm. GAD participants (but not HPs) were less random while worrying than thinking about a positive event during the key-pressing task, suggesting that worry consumed more attentional control resources in this population. During the N-Back task, GAD participants performed worse than HPs during the high load conditions only, indicating greater difficulty in sustaining focus on conditions requiring a higher degree of attentional control, even without concurrent task activity. Poor attentional control might underpin the difficulty of GAD individuals to stop worrying and switch to thinking more benign information. Further research could investigate whether worry consumes attentional control resources in other psychological disorders with high rates of worry (e.g., panic disorder, psychosis), as well as the extent to which attentional control is used by other forms of repetitive thinking, such as depressive rumination.;,citation_author=Evgenia Stefanopoulou;,citation_author=Colette R Hirsch;,citation_author=Sarra Hayes;,citation_author=Anna Adlam;,citation_author=Sian Coker;,citation_publication_date=2014-05;,citation_cover_date=2014-05;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1037/a0036343;,citation_issn=1939-1846 (Electronic);,citation_volume=123;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

Analyses of reaction-times in the experiment lead to the rejection of two of the three sets of theories. There appear to be at least two separate operations in the recognition or classification of a character. The first encodes the visual stimulus as an abstracted representation of its physical properties. The second, which may occur more than once, compares such a stimulus representation to a memory representation, producing either a match or a mismatch. A theory of high-speed exhaustive scanning in memory underlies the experiment and is given new support.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the identification of irritable, headstrong and hurtful dimensions within youth oppositionality would clarify the pattern of associations between oppositionality and a wide range of psychopathology in early and adult life. Methods: Cross-sectional data from national mental health surveys including 18,415 subjects aged 5–16 in the United Kingdom. The main outcome measures were the associations between a priori hypothesised dimensions of oppositionality with psychiatric disorders and symptoms; parent and teacher-derived information were used in multivariate regression analysis. Results: Our three a priori dimensions had very different associations with disorders and symptom scales. Irritability was the only predictor of emotional disorders (parent report: OR = 3.26 [CI 95% 2.79, 3.80]; teacher report: OR = 2.78 [2.39, 3.22]); the hurtful dimension was particularly strongly associated with seeming cold-blooded or callous (parent report: β = .32 [.27, .37]; teacher report: .33 [.30, .36]); and the headstrong dimension was most strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; parent report: OR = 3.21 [2.43, 4.23]; teacher report : OR = 7.18 [5.25, 9.82]). All three dimensions were associated with conduct disorder, with the headstrong dimension being the main predictor of non-aggressive symptoms (parent report: β = .31 [.27, .34]; teacher report: .43 [.40, .45]), and with the hurtful dimension being the main predictor of aggressive symptoms (parent report: β = .35 [.32, .39]; teacher report: .40 [.39, .42]).

To address this gap in the literature, we examined individual differences in neurocognitive functioning domains on math computation in a cross-sectional sample of youth with ADHD. Gender and anxiety symptoms were explored as potential moderators. The sample consisted of 281 youth (aged 8–15 years) diagnosed with ADHD. Neurocognitive tasks assessed auditory-verbal working memory, visuospatial working memory, and processing speed. Auditory-verbal working memory speed significantly predicted math computation. A three-way interaction revealed that at low levels of anxious perfectionism, slower processing speed predicted poorer math computation for boys compared to girls. These findings indicate the uniquely predictive values of auditory-verbal working memory and processing speed on math computation, and their differential moderation. These findings provide preliminary support that gender and anxious perfectionism may influence the relationship between neurocognitive functioning and academic achievement.;,citation_author=Alexandra Sturm;,citation_author=Michelle Rozenman;,citation_author=John C.

The present study sought to examine whether the effects of early family socioeconomic status on children’s working memory were mediated through experiences of caregiving, specifically maternal harsh discipline and responsiveness. Utilizing a psychobiological framework of parenting, the present study also tested whether maternal working memory moderated the initial paths between the family socioeconomic context and maternal harsh discipline and responsiveness in the mediation model. The sample included 185 socioeconomically diverse mother–child dyads assessed when children were 3.5 and 5 years old. Results demonstrated that maternal harsh discipline was a unique mediator of the relation between early experiences of family socioeconomic adversity and lower working memory outcomes in children. Individual differences in maternal working memory emerged as a potent individual difference factor that specifically moderated the mediating influence of harsh discipline within low socioeconomic contexts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Working-memory capacity explains reasoning ability - And a little bit more;,citation_abstract=Working-memory capacity is conceptually differentiated according to functions and contents. The resulting two-faceted structure parallels the structure of intellectual abilities in the Berlin Intelligence Structure Model (BIS) [Diagnostica 28 (1982) 195.]. A battery of 17 working-memory tasks, chosen to represent the proposed facet structure of working memory, was administered together with a test for the BIS to 128 young adults. General working-memory capacity was highly related to general intelligence. The prediction of intellectual abilities by working-memory capacity was also tested by differentiating predictor and criterion according to the functional and to the content facet. Moreover, the paths from working memory to intelligence factors appear to be highly specific. This suggests that specific working-memory resources, as opposed to a general capacity, are the limiting factors for their corresponding counterparts in the structure of mental abilities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The important results were that LD readers’ working memory performance was inferior to skilled readers on verbal and visual-spatial working memory tasks across all age groups and these differences increased on gain and maintenance conditions when compared to initial conditions. These reading group differences remained when age, reading, and mathematics were partialed from the analysis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intelligence, Working Memory, and Learning Disabilities;,citation_abstract=This chapter reviews some of our laboratory research on working memory (WM) in children with normal intelligence who have specific learning disabilities (LD) in reading and/or math. Two general conclusions emerge from this review. First, children with specific LD in reading and/or math are more likely to suffer general WM capacity constraints than average-achieving children, and these constraints are not entirely specific to their academic disability (i.e., reading or math) or intelligence. The reason is that constraints in WM capacity remain in individuals with LD when compared to their counterparts after the influence of achievement and psychometric IQ is partialed out in a statistical analysis. Second, constraints in WM capacity for children with LD are localized to isolated components of the phonological and executive systems. Difficulties related to the phonological system are related to the sequential recall of letters, numbers, real words, and pseudowords, whereas problems in executive processing are related to monitoring (decisions related to the allocation of attention) and interference (suppressing a competing memory trace that draws away from the targeted memory trace). It is further suggested that individuals with LD perform well on some measures of intelligence because (a) they compensate for WM limitations by increasing domain-specific knowledge and/or their reliance on environmental support; and/or (b) those domains or tasks do not place heavy demands on WM capacity.;,citation_author=H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tests of executive functions in first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients: A meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Background. Executive dysfunctions in relatives of schizophrenic patients may be trait markers of genetic liability and thus help us to elucidate the aetiology of schizophrenia. As a large amount of data has been published, a synthesis through a meta-analysis was needed to demonstrate the existence of executive impairments in relatives of schizophrenic patients and to assess their magnitude. Method. We conducted a meta-analysis of articles that compared performances of controls and relatives of schizophrenic patients on the four tests most frequently used to assess executive functions: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Trail Making Test (TMT) , the Stroop Test and the Verbal Fluency (VF) Test. When needed and possible, published data were supplemented with information from the authors. After assessing the homogeneity of the data, effect sizes were estimated and publication bias was tested by use of funnel plots. Results. Relatives of schizophrenic patients performed less well than controls on all executive tests analysed. Effect estimates were in the small to moderate range (from 0.26 to 0.49) for Stroop, WCST and TMT, but were greater for the fluency tests (0.65 for phonological and 0.87 for semantic VF). Conclusion. Relatives of schizophrenic patients appear to have wide, although not severe, executive dysfunctions. As the sensitivity of the different tests for impairments in relatives is not the same, the choice of test and method used should be carefully assessed. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.;,citation_author=Andrei Szöke;,citation_author=Franck Schürhoff;,citation_author=Flavie Mathieu;,citation_author=Alexandre Meary;,citation_author=Serban Ionescu;,citation_author=Marion Leboyer;,citation_publication_date=2005;,citation_cover_date=2005;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1017/S0033291704003460;,citation_issn=00332917;,citation_volume=35;,citation_journal_title=Psychological Medicine;">

To investigate this question, we trained monkeys to perform a working memory task that required memory for multiple stimuli. Performance decreased as a function of number of stimuli to be remembered, but improved as the animals practiced the task. Neuronal recordings acquired during this training revealed two hitherto unknown mechanisms of working memory capacity improvement. First, more prefrontal neurons became active as working memory improved, but their baseline activity decreased. Second, improved working memory capacity was characterized by less variable temporal dynamics, resulting in a more consistent firing rate at each time point during the course of a trial.

Existing measures of IU do not define the uncertainty that respondents perceive as distressing. To address this limitation, we developed eight scales measuring disorder-specific intolerance of uncertainty (DSIU) relating to various anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. We used exploratory factor analysis and item characteristic curves in two large undergraduate samples (Ns = 627 and 628) to derive eight three-item DSIU scales (24 items total) that exhibited excellent psychometric properties. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factor structures of the scales and the transdiagnostic nature of IU. Each scale predicted unique variance in its respective symptom measure beyond a traditional measure of IU. DSIU represents a theoretically proximal and causal intermediary between known vulnerability factors and disorder symptomatology.

Participants filled out the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory Revised and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale and performed a visual search task. This task contained 50 search displays, in which participants indicated whether a target was “present” or “absent”. Target-present trials were straightforward, but target-absent trials were ambiguous, because participants had to rely on not having overlooked the target. Results revealed that target-absent trials induced more uncertainty than targetpresent trials. Furthermore, OC þ participants checked longer than OC À participants in target-absent but not target-present trials. This could not be explained by higher IU in OC þ participants. There were no differences in number of fixations in absent and present trials between the groups. Finally, when looking at the whole range of OC tendencies, there was a positive relation between OC tendencies and checking behavior. The findings (partly) replicated those of Toffolo et al.

Previous work has shown that humans rely on different forms of uncertainty to negotiate this &amp;amp;amp;quot;explore-exploit” trade-off, yet the neural basis of the underlying computations remains unclear. Using fMRI ( n  = 31), we find that relative uncertainty is represented in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drives directed exploration, while total uncertainty is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drives random exploration. The decision value signal combining relative and total uncertainty to compute choice is reflected in motor cortex activity. The variance of this signal scales with total uncertainty, consistent with a sampling mechanism for random exploration. Overall, these results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.;,citation_author=Momchil S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lacking Pace but Not Precision: Age-Related Information Processing Changes in Response to a Dynamic Attentional Control Task;,citation_abstract=Age-related decline in information processing can have a substantial impact on activities such as driving. However, the assessment of these changes is often carried out using cognitive tasks that do not adequately represent the dynamic process of updating environmental stimuli. Equally, traditional tests are often static in their approach to task complexity, and do not assess difficulty within the bounds of an individual’s capability. To address these limitations, we used a more ecologically valid measure, the Swansea Test of Attentional Control (STAC), in which a threshold for information processing speed is established at a given level of accuracy. We aimed to delineate how older, compared to younger, adults varied in their performance of the task, while also assessing relationships between the task outcome and gender, general cognition (MoCA), perceived memory function (MFQ), cognitive reserve (NART), and aspects of mood (PHQ-9, GAD-7). The results indicate that older adults were significantly slower than younger adults but no less precise, irrespective of gender. Age was negatively correlated with the speed of task performance. Our measure of general cognition was positively correlated with the task speed threshold but not with age per se. Perceived memory function, cognitive reserve, and mood were not related to task performance. The findings indicate that while attentional control is less efficient in older adulthood, age alone is not a defining factor in relation to accuracy.

A recent, large genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported a genome-wide significant locus for years of education, which subsequently demonstrated association to general cognitive ability (&amp;amp;amp;quot;g&amp;quot;) in overlapping cohorts. The current study was designed to test whether GWAS hits for educational attainment are involved in general cognitive ability in an independent, large-scale collection of cohorts. Using cohorts in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT; up to 20,495 healthy individuals), we examined the relationship between g and variants associated with educational attainment. We next conducted meta-analyses with 24,189 individuals with neurocognitive data from the educational attainment studies, and then with 53,188 largely independent individuals from a recent GWAS of cognition. A SNP (rs1906252) located at chromosome 6q16.1, previously associated with years of schooling, was significantly associated with g (P = 1.47 × 10(-4) ) in COGENT. The first joint analysis of 43,381 non-overlapping individuals for this a priori-designated locus was strongly significant (P = 4.94 × 10(-7) ), and the second joint analysis of 68,159 non-overlapping individuals was even more robust (P = 1.65 × 10(-9) ).

Specifically, we examined whether improvements in working memory maintenance and manipulation from childhood to early adulthood predicted the reduction of ADHD symptoms as a function of allelic variation in DRD1 and DRD2. Participants were 76 7-11-year-old children with ADHD who were genotyped and prospectively followed for almost 10 years. ADHD symptoms were rated using the Attention Problems scale on the Child Behavior Checklist, and verbal working memory maintenance and manipulation, measured by Digit Span forward and backward, respectively, were assessed at baseline and follow-up. After correction for multiple testing, improvements in working memory manipulation, not maintenance, predicted reduction of symptomatology over development and was moderated by major allele homozygosity in two DRD1 polymorphisms (rs4532 and rs265978) previously linked with variation in D1 receptor expression. Depending on genetic background, developmental factors including age-dependent variation in DRD1 penetrance may facilitate the link between improvements in higher-order working memory and the remission of symptoms in individuals with childhood-diagnosed ADHD. Furthermore, the current findings suggest that DRD1 might contribute minimally to the emergence of symptoms and cognitive difficulties associated with ADHD in childhood, but may act as a modifier gene of these clinical features and outcome during later development for those with ADHD.;,citation_author=Joey W Trampush;,citation_author=Michelle M Jacobs;,citation_author=Yasmin L Hurd;,citation_author=Jeffrey H Newcorn;,citation_author=Jeffrey M Halperin;,citation_publication_date=2014-01;,citation_cover_date=2014-01;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410775

However, less is known about the course of cognitive functioning, following the first presentation of psychosis, and the relationship of cognition to clinical course during initial treatment. The present longitudinal study examined the magnitude of neurocognitive impairment, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis at baseline and after 12 weeks of randomized antipsychotic treatment with either aripiprazole or risperidone. At baseline, FES patients evidenced marked impairments in cognitive functioning. Notably, performance on the mazes task of planning and reasoning significantly predicted the likelihood of meeting stringent criteria for positive symptom remission during the first 12 weeks of the trial. Performance on indices of general cognitive function, working memory, and verbal learning improved over time, but these improvements were mediated by improvements in both positive and negative symptoms. We did not detect any differential effects of antipsychotic medication assignment (aripiprazole vs risperidone) on cognitive functioning.

Validation data are presented for 268 participants ages 20 to 85 years. A subset of participants ( N =89) was retested 7 to 21 days later. As expected, the List Sorting Test had moderately high correlations with other measures of working memory and executive functioning (convergent validity) but a low correlation with a test of receptive vocabulary (discriminant validity). Furthermore, List Sorting demonstrates expected changes over the age span and has excellent test–retest reliability. Collectively, these results provide initial support for the construct validity of the List Sorting Working Memory Measure as a measure of working memory.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is working memory capacity task dependent?;,citation_abstract=The complex span measure of working memory is a word/digit span measured while performing a secondary task. Two experiments investigated whether correlations between the complex span and reading comprehension depend on the nature of the secondary task and individual skill in that task. The secondary task did not have to be reading related for the span to predict reading comprehension. An arithmetic-related secondary task led to correlations with reading comprehension similar to those found when the secondary task was reading. The relationship remained significant when quantitative skills were factored out of the complex span/comprehension correlations. Simple digit and word spans (measured without a background task) did not correlate with reading comprehension and SAT scores. The second experiment showed that the complex span/comprehension correlations were a function of the difficulty of the background task. When the difficulty level of the reading-related or arithmetic-related background tasks was moderate, the span/comprehension correlations were higher in magnitude than when the background tasks were very simple, or, were very difficult. © 1989.;,citation_author=Marilyn L.

The current study investigated the cognitive dynamics underlying reading development in a large school sample ranging from beginning to experienced readers. The results showed that phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) contributed substantially to reading fluency over all six primary school grades. However, the relationship between PA and word (but not pseudoword) reading fluency decreased as a function of reading experience, whereas the relationship between RAN and word reading fluency increased gradually. Moreover, this cognitive shift was most pronounced for high-frequency words.

Each model is then a point in a 3-factor model space containing a total of 32 models, of which only 6 have been tested previously. We compare all models on data from 10 delayed-estimation experiments from 6 laboratories (for a total of 164 subjects and 131,452 trials). Consistently across experiments, we find that (a) mnemonic precision is not quantized but continuous and not equal but variable across items and trials; (b) the number of remembered items is likely to be variable across trials, with a mean of 6.4 in the best model (median across subjects); (c) spatial binding errors occur but explain only a small fraction of responses (16.5% at set size 8 in the best model).

Besides reaction time (RT) and accuracy, we measured response force and derived two measures from the event-related EEG potential to form an index for attentional orienting (posterior contralateral negativity: PCN) and the start of motor activation (the lateralized readiness potential: LRP). For the choice-by-location task and the Simon task, effects of time pressure were found on the response-locked LRP, but not on the onset of the PCN and the stimulus-locked LRP. Thus, strategy influences processing after the start of motor activation in choice tasks. A small effect of time pressure was found on the peak latency of the PCN in the Simon task, which suggests that time pressure may affect attentional orienting. In the simple response task, time pressure reduced the amplitude of the PCN. This finding suggests that strategy affects attentional orienting to stimuli when these stimuli are not highly relevant. Finally, the effect of time pressure on RT was much larger in the simple response task than in the other tasks, which may be ascribed to the possibility of preparing the required response in the simple response task.;,citation_author=Rob H.

Abnormal brain development precipitated by early exposure to the extra-uterine environment, and exacerbated by neuroinflammation, neonatal brain injury, and genetic vulnerability , can result in alterations of brain structure and function persisting into adulthood. These alterations, including abnormal regional brain volumes and white matter macroand micro-structure, can critically impair functional (e.g. frontoparietal and thalamocortical) network connectivity in a manner characteristic of psychotic illness. The resulting executive, social, and motor dysfunctions may constitute the basis for behavioural vulnerability ultimately giving rise to psychotic symptomatology.

Moreover, low fear of punishment and physiological underactivity may predispose antisocial individuals to seek out stimulation or take risks and may help to explain poor conditioning and socialization.

Reaction times were shorter on trials with lower tonic, and higher phasic arousal. Additionally, these two pupil measures were predictive of a unique set of EEG signatures that together represent multiple information processing steps of decision-making.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic correlations of polygenic disease traits: From theory to practice;,citation_abstract=The genetic correlation describes the genetic relationship between two traits and can contribute to a better understanding of the shared biological pathways and/or the causality relationships between them. The rarity of large family cohorts with recorded instances of two traits, particularly disease traits, has made it difficult to estimate genetic correlations using traditional epidemiological approaches. However, advances in genomic methodologies, such as genome-wide association studies, and widespread sharing of data now allow genetic correlations to be estimated for virtually any trait pair. Here, we review the definition, estimation, interpretation and uses of genetic correlations, with a focus on applications to human disease.;,citation_author=Wouter Rheenen;,citation_author=Wouter J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High Reading Skills Mask Dyslexia in Gifted Children;,citation_abstract=This study investigated how gifted children with dyslexia might be able to mask literacy problems and the role of possible compensatory mechanisms. The sample consisted of 121 Dutch primary school children that were divided over four groups (typically developing [TD] children, children with dyslexia, gifted children, gifted children with dyslexia). The test battery included measures of literacy (reading/spelling) and cognitive abilities related to literacy and language (phonological awareness [PA], rapid automatized naming [RAN], verbal short-term memory [VSTM], working memory [WM], grammar, and vocabulary). It was hypothesized that gifted children with dyslexia would outperform children with dyslexia on literacy tests. In addition, a core-deficit model including dyslexia-related weaknesses and a compensational model involving giftedness-related strengths were tested using Bayesian statistics to explain their reading/spelling performance. Gifted children with dyslexia performed on all literacy tests in between children with dyslexia and TD children. Their cognitive profile showed signs of weaknesses in PA and RAN and strengths in VSTM, WM, and language skills. Findings indicate that phonology is a risk factor for gifted children with dyslexia, but this is moderated by other skills such as WM, grammar, and vocabulary, providing opportunities for compensation of a cognitive deficit and masking of literacy difficulties.;,citation_author=Sietske Viersen;,citation_author=Evelyn H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Consciousness and working memory: Current trends and research perspectives;,citation_abstract=Working memory has long been thought to be closely related to consciousness. However, recent empirical studies show that unconscious content may be maintained within working memory and that complex cognitive computations may be performed on-line. This promotes research on the exact relationships between consciousness and working memory. Current evidence for working memory being a conscious as well as an unconscious process is reviewed. Consciousness is shown to be considered a subset of working memory by major current theories of working memory. Evidence for unconscious elements in working memory is shown to come from visual masking and attentional blink paradigms, and from the studies of implicit working memory. It is concluded that more research is needed to explicate the relationship between consciousness and working memory. Future research directions regarding the relationship between consciousness and working memory are discussed.;,citation_author=Boris B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Inhibitory Lateral Hypothalamic-Preoptic Circuit Mediates Rapid Arousals from Sleep;,citation_abstract=Among the neuronal populations implicated in sleepwake control, the ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) nucleus has emerged as a key sleep-promoting center. However, the synaptic drives that regulate the VLPO to control arousal levels in vivo have not to date been identified. Here, we show that sleep-promoting galaninergic neurons within the VLPO nucleus, defined pharmacologically and by single-cell transcript analysis, are postsynaptic targets of lateral hypothalamic GABAergic (LHGABA) neurons and that activation of this pathway in vivo rapidly drives wakefulness. Ca2+ imaging from LHGABA neurons indicate that they are both wake and rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep active. Consistent with the potent arousal-promoting property of the LHGABA / VLPO pathway, presynaptic inputs to LHGABA neurons originate from several canonical stress- and arousalrelated network nodes. This work represents the first demonstration that direct synaptic inhibition of the VLPO area can suppress sleep-promoting neurons to rapidly promote arousal.;,citation_author=Anne Venner;,citation_author=Roberto De Luca;,citation_author=Lauren T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disentangling polygenic associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, educational attainment, literacy and language;,citation_abstract=© 2019, The Author(s). Interpreting polygenic overlap between ADHD and both literacy-related and language-related impairments is challenging as genetic associations might be influenced by indirectly shared genetic factors. Here, we investigate genetic overlap between polygenic ADHD risk and multiple literacy-related and/or language-related abilities (LRAs), as assessed in UK children (N ≤ 5919), accounting for genetically predictable educational attainment (EA). Genome-wide summary statistics on clinical ADHD and years of schooling were obtained from large consortia (N ≤ 326,041). Our findings show that ADHD-polygenic scores (ADHD-PGS) were inversely associated with LRAs in ALSPAC, most consistently with reading-related abilities, and explained ≤1.6% phenotypic variation. These polygenic links were then dissected into both ADHD effects shared with and independent of EA, using multivariable regressions (MVR). Conditional on EA, polygenic ADHD risk remained associated with multiple reading and/or spelling abilities, phonemic awareness and verbal intelligence, but not listening comprehension and non-word repetition. Using conservative ADHD-instruments (P-threshold \textless 5 × 10 −8 ), this corresponded, for example, to a 0.35 SD decrease in pooled reading performance per log-odds in ADHD-liability (P = 9.2 × 10 −5 ). Using subthreshold ADHD-instruments (P-threshold \ textless 0.0015), these effects became smaller, with a 0.03 SD decrease per log-odds in ADHD risk (P = 1.4 × 10 −6 ), although the predictive accuracy increased. However, polygenic ADHD-effects shared with EA were of equal strength and at least equal magnitude compared to those independent of EA, for all LRAs studied, and detectable using subthreshold instruments. Thus, ADHD-related polygenic links with LRAs are to a large extent due to shared genetic effects with EA, although there is evidence for an ADHD-specific association profile, independent of EA, that primarily involves literacy-related impairments.;,citation_author=Ellen Verhoef;,citation_author=Ditte Demontis;,citation_author=Stephen Burgess;,citation_author=Chin Yang Shapland;,citation_author=Philip S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Functional network topology of the right insula affects emotion dysregulation in hyperactive-impulsive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder;,citation_abstract=Emotion dysregulation is common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is highly prevalent in young adult ADHD and related to reduced well-being and social impairments. Neuroimaging studies reported neural activity changes in ADHD in brain regions associated with emotion processing and regulation. It is however unknown whether deficits in emotion regulation relate to changes in functional brain network topology in these regions. We used a combination of graph analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyze resting-state functional connectivity in 147 well-characterized young adults with ADHD and age-matched healthy controls from the NeuroIMAGE database. Emotion dysregulation was gauged with four scales obtained from questionnaires and operationalized through a latent variable derived from SEM. Graph analysis was applied to resting-state data and network topology measures were entered into SEM models to identify brain regions whose local network integration and connectedness differed between subjects and was associated with emotion dysregulation. The latent variable of emotion dysregulation was characterized by scales gauging emotional distress, emotional symptoms, conduct symptoms, and emotional lability. In individuals with ADHD characterized by prominent hyperactivity-impulsivity, the latent emotion dysregulation variable was related to an increased clustering and local efficiency of the right insula. Thus, in the presence of hyperactivity-impulsivity, clustered network formation of the right insula may underpin emotion dysregulation in young adult ADHD.;,citation_author=Tammo Viering;,citation_author=Pieter J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling Linkage Disequilibrium Increases Accuracy of Polygenic Risk Scores;,citation_abstract=Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R2 increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.;,citation_author=Bjarni J. Vilhjálmsson;,citation_author=Jian Yang;,citation_author=Hilary K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Statistical Power to Detect Genetic (Co)Variance of Complex Traits Using SNP Data in Unrelated Samples;,citation_abstract=We have recently developed analysis methods (GREML) to estimate the genetic variance of a complex trait/disease and the genetic correlation between two complex traits/diseases using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in unrelated individuals. Here we use analytical derivations and simulations to quantify the sampling variance of the estimate of the proportion of phenotypic variance captured by all SNPs for quantitative traits and case-control studies. We also derive the approximate sampling variance of the estimate of a genetic correlation in a bivariate analysis, when two complex traits are either measured on the same or different individuals. We show that the sampling variance is inversely proportional to the number of pairwise contrasts in the analysis and to the variance in SNP-derived genetic relationships. For bivariate analysis, the sampling variance of the genetic correlation additionally depends on the harmonic mean of the proportion of variance explained by the SNPs for the two traits and the genetic correlation between the traits, and depends on the phenotypic correlation when the traits are measured on the same individuals. We provide an online tool for calculating the power of detecting genetic (co)variation using genome-wide SNP data. The new theory and online tool will be helpful to plan experimental designs to estimate the missing heritability that has not yet been fully revealed through genome-wide association studies, and to estimate the genetic overlap between complex traits (diseases) in particular when the traits (diseases) are not measured on the same samples.;,citation_author=Peter M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural activity predicts individual differences in visual working memory capacity.;,citation_abstract=Contrary to our rich phenomenological visual experience, our visual short-term memory system can maintain representations of only three to four objects at any given moment. For over a century, the capacity of visual memory has been shown to vary substantially across individuals, ranging from 1.5 to about 5 objects. Although numerous studies have recently begun to characterize the neural substrates of visual memory processes, a neurophysiological index of storage capacity limitations has not yet been established. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for lateralized activity in humans that reflects the encoding and maintenance of items in visual memory. The amplitude of this activity is strongly modulated by the number of objects being held in the memory at the time, but approaches a limit asymptotically for arrays that meet or exceed storage capacity. Indeed, the precise limit is determined by each individual’s memory capacity, such that the activity from low-capacity individuals reaches this plateau much sooner than that from high-capacity individuals. Consequently, this measure provides a strong neurophysiological predictor of an individual’s capacity, allowing the demonstration of a direct relationship between neural activity and memory capacity.;,citation_author=Edward K Vogel;,citation_author=Maro G Machizawa;,citation_publication_date=2004-04;,citation_cover_date=2004-04;,citation_year=2004;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15085132;,citation_issue=6984;,citation_doi=10.1038/nature02447;,citation_issn=1476-4687;,citation_volume=428;,citation_journal_title=Nature;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural measures reveal individual differences in controlling access to working memory.;,citation_abstract=The capacity of visual short-term memory is highly limited, maintaining only three to four objects simultaneously. This extreme limitation necessitates efficient mechanisms to select only the most relevant objects from the immediate environment to be represented in memory and to restrict irrelevant items from consuming capacity. Here we report a neurophysiological measure of this memory selection mechanism in humans that gauges an individual’s efficiency at excluding irrelevant items from being stored in memory. By examining the moment-by-moment contents of visual memory, we observe that selection efficiency varies substantially across individuals and is strongly predicted by the particular memory capacity of each person. Specifically, high capacity individuals are much more efficient at representing only the relevant items than are low capacity individuals, who inefficiently encode and maintain information about the irrelevant items present in the display. These results provide evidence that under many circumstances low capacity individuals may actually store more information in memory than high capacity individuals. Indeed, this ancillary allocation of memory capacity to irrelevant objects may be a primary source of putative differences in overall storage capacity.;,citation_author=Edward K Vogel;,citation_author=Andrew W McCollough;,citation_author=Maro G Machizawa;,citation_publication_date=2005-11;,citation_cover_date=2005-11;,citation_year=2005;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16306992;,citation_issue=7067;,citation_doi=10.1038/nature04171;,citation_issn=1476-4687;,citation_volume=438;,citation_journal_title=Nature;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects and mechanisms of working memory training: A review;,citation_abstract=© 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Can cognitive abilities such as reasoning be improved through working memory training? This question is still highly controversial, with prior studies providing contradictory findings. The lack of theory-driven, systematic approaches and (occasionally serious) methodological shortcomings complicates this debate even more. This review suggests two general mechanisms mediating transfer effects that are (or are not) observed after working memory training: enhanced working memory capacity, enabling people to hold more items in working memory than before training, or enhanced efficiency using the working memory capacity available (e.g., using chunking strategies to remember more items correctly). We then highlight multiple factors that could influence these mechanisms of transfer and thus the success of training interventions. These factors include (1) the nature of the training regime (i.e., intensity, duration, and adaptivity of the training tasks) and, with it, the magnitude of improvements during training, and (2) individual differences in age, cognitive abilities, biological factors, and motivational and personality factors. Finally, we summarize the findings revealed by existing training studies for each of these factors, and thereby present a roadmap for accumulating further empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of working memory training in a systematic way.;,citation_author=Claudia C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Induced-anxiety differentially disrupts working memory in generalized anxiety disorder;,citation_abstract=Background: Anxiety is characterized by a bias towards threatening information, anxious apprehension, and disrupted concentration. Previous research in healthy subjects suggests that working memory (WM) is disrupted by induced anxiety, but that increased task-demand reduces anxiety and WM is preserved. However, it is unknown if patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can similarly normalize their performance on difficult WM tasks while reducing their anxiety. Increased threat-related bias and impoverished top-down control in trait anxiety suggests that patients may not reap the same cognitive and emotional benefits from demanding tasks that those low in anxiety. Here we examine this possibility using a WM task of varying difficulty. Methods: GAD patients (N = 30) and healthy controls (N = 30) performed an n-back task (no-load, 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back) while at risk for shock (threat) or safe from shock (safe). Anxiety was measured via startle reflex and self-report. Results: As predicted, healthy controls’ performance was impaired under threat during low-load tasks and facilitated during high-load tasks. In contrast, GAD patients’ performance was impaired under threat regardless of WM load. Anxiety was reduced as cognitive load increased in both groups. Conclusions: The divergence of emotion regulation (reduction) and performance (persistent impairment) in the patient but not the control group, suggests that different top-down mechanisms may be operating to reduce anxiety. Continued WM disruption in patients indicates that attentional resources are allocated to emotion regulation instead of goal-directed behavior. Implications for our understanding of cognitive disruption in patients, and related therapeutic interventions are discussed.;,citation_author=Katherine E Vytal;,citation_author=Nicole E Arkin;,citation_author=Cassie Overstreet;,citation_author=Lynne Lieberman;,citation_author=Christian Grillon;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0748-2;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12888-016-0748-2;,citation_issn=1471244X;,citation_volume=16;,citation_journal_title=BMC Psychiatry;,citation_publisher=BMC Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=External validation of a bifactor model of oppositional defiant disorder;,citation_abstract=Dimensions of irritability and defiant behavior, though correlated within the structure of ODD, convey separable developmental risks through adolescence and adulthood. Irritability predicts depression and anxiety, whereas defiant behavior is a precursor to antisocial outcomes. Previously we demonstrated that a bifactor model comprising irritability and defiant behavior dimensions, in addition to a general factor, provided the best-fitting structure of ODD symptoms in five large datasets. Herein we extend our previous work by externally validating the bifactor model of ODD using multiple regression and multivariate behavior genetic analyses. We used parent ratings of DSM IV ODD symptoms, and symptom dimensions for ADHD (i.e., inattention and hyperactivity−impulsivity), conduct disorder (CD), depression/dysthymia, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from 846 6−18-year-old twin pairs. We found that the ODD irritability factor was associated only with depression/dysthymia and GAD and the ODD defiant behavior factor was associated only with inattention, hyperactivity−impulsivity, and CD, whereas the ODD general factor was associated with all five symptom dimensions. Multivariate behavior genetic analyses found all five symptom dimensions shared genetic influences in common with the ODD general , irritability, and defiant behavior factors. In contrast, the defiant behavior factor shared genetic influences uniquely with inattention and hyperactivity−impulsivity, whereas the irritability factor shared genetic influences uniquely with depression/dysthymia and GAD, but not vice versa. This suggests that genes that influence irritability in early childhood also predispose to depression and anxiety in adolescence and adulthood. These multivariate genetic findings also support the external validity of the three ODD dimensions at the etiological level. Our study provides additional support for subtyping ODD based on these symptom dimensions, as in the revisions in the ICD-11, and suggests potential mechanisms underlying the development from ODD to behavioral or affective disorders.;,citation_author=Irwin D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Enhancing gesture decoding performance using signals from posterior parietal cortex: A stereo-electroencephalograhy (SEEG) study;,citation_abstract=Objective. Hand movement is a crucial function for humans’ daily life. Developing brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic hand by brain signals would help the severely paralyzed people partially regain the functional independence. Previous intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)-based BMIs towards gesture decoding mostly used neural signals from the primary sensorimotor cortex while ignoring the hand movement related signals from posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Here, we propose combining iEEG recordings from PPC with that from primary sensorimotor cortex to enhance the gesture decoding performance of iEEG-based BMI. Approach. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals from 25 epilepsy subjects were recorded when they performed a three-class hand gesture task. Across all 25 subjects, we identified 524, 114 and 221 electrodes from three regions of interest (ROIs), including PPC , postcentral cortex (POC) and precentral cortex (PRC), respectively. Based on the time-varying high gamma power (55-150 Hz) of SEEG signal, both the general activation in the task and the fine selectivity to gestures of each electrode in these ROIs along time was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2. According to the activation along time, we further assessed the first activation time of each ROI. Finally, the decoding accuracy for gestures was obtained by linear support vector machine classifier to comparatively explore if the PPC will assist PRC and POC for gesture decoding. Main results. We find that a majority(L: $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 60%, R: $&amp;gt;$ 40%) of electrodes in all the three ROIs present significant activation during the task. A large scale temporal activation sequence exists among the ROIs, where PPC activates first, PRC second and POC last. Among the activated electrodes, 15% (PRC), 26% (POC) and 4% (left PPC) of electrodes are significantly selective to gestures. Moreover, decoding accuracy obtained by combining the selective electrodes from three ROIs together is 5%, 3.6%, and 8% higher than that from only PRC and POC when decoding features across, before, and after the movement onset, were used. Significance. This is the first human iEEG study demonstrating that PPC contains neural information about fine hand movement, supporting the role of PPC in hand shape encoding. Combining PPC with primary sensorimotor cortex can provide more information to improve the gesture decoding performance. Our results suggest that PPC could be a rich neural source for iEEG-based BMI. Our findings also demonstrate the early involvement of human PPC in visuomotor task and thus may provide additional implications for further scientific research and BMI applications.;,citation_author=Meng Wang;,citation_author=Guangye Li;,citation_author=Shize Jiang;,citation_author=Zixuan Wei;,citation_author=Jie Hu;,citation_author=Liang Chen;,citation_author=Dingguo Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2020-08-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-08-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ab9987;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1088/1741-2552/ab9987;,citation_issn=1741-2560, 1741-2552;,citation_volume=17;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

Results of moderation analyses showed that (a) spatial WM was more severely impaired than verbal WM and (b) the component of cognitive processing (maintenance vs. maintenance plus manipulation) did not affect the severity of WM impairments.

Dopamine is critical in pathophysiology and therapy of schizophrenia. Many studies have reported altered dopaminergic activity in the dorsal but not ventral striatum in schizophrenia. Based on the largest genome-wide association study of schizophrenia to date, we calculated the polygenic risk score (PGRS) of each subject in a healthy general group, including all variations in the set of functionally related genes involved in dopamine neurotransmitter system. We aimed to test whether the genetic variations in the dopaminergic pathway that have been identified as associated with schizophrenia are related to the function of the striatum and to working memory. We found that a higher PGRS was significantly associated with impairment in working memory. Moreover, resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that as the polygenic risk score increased, the connections between left putamen and caudate and the default mode network grew stronger, while the connections with the fronto-parietal network grew weaker.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neuronal basis of age-related working memory decline.;,citation_abstract=Many of the cognitive deficits of normal ageing (forgetfulness, distractibility, inflexibility and impaired executive functions) involve prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. The PFC guides behaviour and thought using working memory, which are essential functions in the information age. Many PFC neurons hold information in working memory through excitatory networks that can maintain persistent neuronal firing in the absence of external stimulation. This fragile process is highly dependent on the neurochemical environment. For example, elevated cyclic-AMP signalling reduces persistent firing by opening HCN and KCNQ potassium channels. It is not known if molecular changes associated with normal ageing alter the physiological properties of PFC neurons during working memory, as there have been no in vivo recordings, to our knowledge, from PFC neurons of aged monkeys. Here we characterize the first recordings of this kind, revealing a marked loss of PFC persistent firing with advancing age that can be rescued by restoring an optimal neurochemical environment. Recordings showed an age-related decline in the firing rate of DELAY neurons, whereas the firing of CUE neurons remained unchanged with age. The memory-related firing of aged DELAY neurons was partially restored to more youthful levels by inhibiting cAMP signalling, or by blocking HCN or KCNQ channels. These findings reveal the cellular basis of age-related cognitive decline in dorsolateral PFC, and demonstrate that physiological integrity can be rescued by addressing the molecular needs of PFC circuits.;,citation_author=Min Wang;,citation_author=Nao J Gamo;,citation_author=Yang Yang;,citation_author=Lu E Jin;,citation_author=Xiao Jing Wang;,citation_author=Mark Laubach;,citation_author=James A Mazer;,citation_author=Daeyeol Lee;,citation_author=Amy F.

Working memory deficits are present in several psychiatric disorders, and there is wide variation in working memory capacity in the normal population. Association studies of COMT and working memory in healthy volunteers have yielded inconsistent results, possibly because of small sample sizes. Here we examine COMT in relation to N-Back working memory task performance in a large population-based cohort of young adults. We predicted individuals with one or two copies of the Met allele would perform better, and that this relationship would be more evident in males than females. Participants (N=1857-2659) tested at 18 years of age, were enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We used multiple regression to examine effects of sex and COMT genotype on N-Back hits, false positives, discriminability (d’), and reaction time while controlling for important covariates. COMT genotype did not predict hits or d’. There was a nominally significant interaction between COMT and sex on false positives, but this was not in the predicted direction, and was not significant after controlling for covariates. COMT genotype was not related to working memory in this large population-based cohort.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The new Swedish Prescribed Drug Register—Opportunities for pharmacoepidemiological research and experience from the first six months;,citation_abstract=Abstract Purpose To describe the content and potentials of the new Swedish national register on prescribed and dispensed medicines. Methods The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains information about age, sex and unique identifier of the patient as well as the prescriber’s profession and practice. Information regarding drug utilization and expenditures for prescribed drugs in the entire Swedish population was extracted from the first six months July–December 2005 and compared with total drug sales in the country including OTC and hospital use. Results The total quantity of drugs sold in Sweden was 2666 million DDDs, corresponding to 1608 DDD/1000 inhabitants daily. The total expenditures were 1.6 billion Euro. The prescribed drugs, included in the register, accounted for 84% of the total utilization and 77% of the total expenditures. About half of all men and two-thirds of all women in the country purchased drugs. The proportion increased by age. The most common drugs for chronic treatment were diuretics among women (8.8% of the population) and antithrombotic agents among men (7.6 %). Psychotropic drugs, corticosteroids and analgesics were more common among women, while men used antithrombotic agents, antidiabetic drugs, lipid lowering agents and ACE inhibitors to a greater extent. Conclusions The new register provides valuable data on exposure to drugs and is useful to study patterns of drug utilization. The possibilities for record linkage to other health registers gives from an international perspective good opportunities to explore drug and disease associations and the risks, benefits, effectiveness and health economical effects of drug use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Facial Affect Sensitivity Training for Young Children with  Emerging CU Traits: An Experimental Therapeutics Approach;,citation_abstract=Objective This article delineates best practices in the application of the experimental therapeutics framework for evaluating interventions within the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), offering a methodological primer and guiding framework for this approach. We illustrate these practices using an ongoing clinical trial conducted within the framework of a National Institute of Mental Health exploratory phased-innovation award for the development of psychosocial therapeutic interventions for mental disorders (R61/R33), describing the implementation of a novel “Facial Affect Sensitivity Training” (FAST) intervention for children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits. CU traits (e.g., lack of guilt or remorse, low empathy, shallow affect) are an established risk factor for persistent and severe youth misconduct, which reflect impairment in identified neurocognitive mechanisms that interfere with child socialization, and predict poor treatment outcomes, even with well-established treatments for disruptive behavior.Method We outline the stages, goals, and best practices for an experimental therapeutics framework. In the FAST trial, we assert that impaired sensitivity for emotional distress cues (fear and/or sadness) is mechanistically linked to CU traits in children, and that by targeting sensitivity to facial affect directly via a computerized automated feedback and incentive system, we can exert downstream effects on CU traits.Results In the context of an open pilot trial, we found preliminary support for feasibility and mechanism engagement using FAST.Conclusions We summarize pilot study limitations and how they are being addressed in the R61/R33 RCTs, as well as challenges and future directions for psychosocial experimental therapeutics.;,citation_author=Bradley A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The benefits of adding a brief measure of simple reaction time to the assessment of executive function skills in early childhood;,citation_abstract=Early childhood represents a period of rapid cognitive developmental change in executive function (EF) skills along with a variety of related cognitive processes, including processing speed. This leads to interpretational challenges in that children’s performance on EF tasks reflects more than EF skills per se. We tested whether the inclusion of a brief measure of simple reaction time (SRT) during EF assessments could help to partially address this challenge. Data were drawn from a cross-sectional convenience sample of 830 preschool-aged children. Individual differences in SRT were significantly associated with performance on all tasks (R2s = .09–.26); slower performance on the SRT task was associated with poorer performance on each EF task. Age-related differences in individual EF tasks were reduced by approximately one half after accounting for age-related differences in SRT, and EF task scores were less coherent (i.e., less strongly intercorrelated with each other) after the removal of SRT. Age-related differences in EF were smaller (Cohen ds = 1.36 vs. 0.78), and poverty-related differences in EF were larger (Cohen ds = 0.30 vs. 0.46) after accounting for SRT-related variation. Finally, consistent with previous studies, SRT-related differences in fluid reasoning were mediated by EF skills. Results are discussed with respect to using a brief measure of SRT to partially address the problem of measurement impurity at the level of individual EF tasks.;,citation_author=Michael T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is there a dysgenic secular trend towards slowing simple reaction time? Responding to a quartet of critical commentaries;,citation_abstract=Previously Woodley, te Nijenhuis and Murphy (2013) tested the hypothesis that Victorian era British and American samples exhibited higher g on average than relatively more modern populations sampled from the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Finland, using measures of simple visual reaction time in a meta-analytic study. Based on 13 age-matched studies from Western countries conducted between 1884 and 2004 yielding 16 data points we estimated a decline of - 13.35 IQ points. Here we respond to a quartet of critical commentaries on our paper (Flynn penned by five prominent intelligence researchers (James Flynn, Theodore Nettelbeck, Irwin Silverman, Julia Dodonova and Yuri Dodonov). We show via various reanalyses of the data and also via careful consideration of the arguments presented that the original finding of a potential secular decline in simple reaction time performance is robust. A recurrent criticism of our finding stems from earlier work showing no secular trends with respect to inspection time over a 20-year period in Australia despite the possibility of co-occurring dysgenic fertility. We deal with this via the method of correlated vectors, which reveals the presence of a ’genetic g’ common factor on which simple RTs, WAIS g loadings and subtest heritabilities load positively and significantly, but on which inspection time does not load. This indicates that inspection times are associated with local information processing, unlike simple reaction times, which are associated with global processing (i.e. g). The robustness of our original finding is best illustrated however by our final meta-regression, in which the use of six methods variance-controlled reaction time means taken from the US and the UK between 1889 and 1993, coupled with a newly-estimated age-matched reference standard deviation, reveal a seemingly robust secular trend towards slowing reaction time in these two countries, which translates into a potential dysgenics rate of - 1.21 IQ points per decade, or - 13.9 points in total between 1889 and 2004. We conclude by arguing that the best way forward is to test novel predictions stemming from our finding relating to molecular genetics, neurophysiology and alternative cognitive indicators, thus shifting the research focus away from the purely methodological level towards the broader nomological level. We thank our critics for helping us to arrive at a much more precise estimate of the decline in general intelligence. © 2014.;,citation_author=Michael A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors influencing the latency of simple reaction time;,citation_abstract=Simple reaction time (SRT), the minimal time needed to respond to a stimulus, is a basic measure of processing speed. SRTs were first measured by Francis Galton in the 19th century, who reported visual SRT latencies below 190 ms in young subjects. However, recent large-scale studies have reported substantially increased SRT latencies that differ markedly in different laboratories, in part due to timing delays introduced by the computer hardware and software used for SRT measurement. We developed a calibrated and temporally precise SRT test to analyze the factors that influence SRT latencies in a paradigm where visual stimuli were presented to the left or right hemifield at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Experiment 1 examined a community sample of 1469 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 65. Mean SRT latencies were short (231, 213 ms when corrected for hardware delays) and increased significantly with age (0.55 ms/year), but were unaffected by sex or education. As in previous studies, SRTs were prolonged at shorter SOAs and were slightly faster for stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the responding hand. Stimulus detection time (SDT) was estimated by subtracting movement initiation time, measured in a speeded finger tapping test, from SRTs. SDT latencies averaged 131 ms and were unaffected by age. Experiment 2 tested 189 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 82 years in a different laboratory using a larger range of SOAs. Both SRTs and SDTs were slightly prolonged (by 7 ms). SRT latencies increased with age while SDT latencies remained stable. Precise computer-based measurements of SRT latencies show that processing speed is as fast in contemporary populations as in the Victorian era, and that age-related increases in SRT latencies are due primarily to slowed motor output.;,citation_author=David L.

However, it is unclear if response selection impairment transcends sensory and motor modalities or is modality specific. To address this question, healthy subjects and individuals with schizophrenia completed reaction time (RT) experiments with different combinations of sensory cues (i.e. visual, auditory) and motor response (i.e. manual, vocal). We found that response selection impairment in schizophrenia was present regardless of the sensory and motor modality of the tasks and correlated with performance on neuropsychological tests of processing speed.

Here, we demonstrate an analytical paradigm of prioritizing genes and regulatory elements at GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. We perform an integrative analysis that uses summary-level SNP data from multi-omics studies to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with gene expression and phenotype through shared genetic effects (i.e., pleiotropy). We identify pleiotropic associations between 7858 DNAm sites and 2733 genes. These DNAm sites are enriched in enhancers and promoters, and \textgreater40% of them are mapped to distal genes. Further pleiotropic association analyses, which link both the methylome and transcriptome to 12 complex traits, identify 149 DNAm sites and 66 genes, indicating a plausible mechanism whereby the effect of a genetic variant on phenotype is mediated by genetic regulation of transcription through DNAm.;,citation_author=Yang Wu;,citation_author=Jian Zeng;,citation_author=Futao Zhang;,citation_author=Zhihong Zhu;,citation_author=Ting Qi;,citation_author=Zhili Zheng;,citation_author=Luke R.

GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait.

We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation.

Moreover, we know from work in neurophysiology that the prefrontal cortex is disproportionately susceptibly to the pathological effects of aging. The n-back task is arguably the most ubiquitous cognitive task for investigating working memory performance. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups: young (23.57 ± 5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13 ± 5.63 years) and older (66.86 ± 5.70 years) adults. Findings show that the three groups share concordance in the engagement of parietal and cingulate cortices, which have been consistently identified as core areas involved in working memory; as well as the insula, claustrum, and cerebellum, which have not been highlighted as areas involved in working memory. Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement.

Subdural strip and grid electrode (SDE) implantations have long been used as the mainstay of intracranial seizure localization in the United States. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an alternative approach in which depth electrodes are placed through percutaneous drill holes to stereotactically defined coordinates in the brain. Long used in certain centers in Europe, SEEG is gaining wider popularity in North America, bolstered by the advent of stereotactic robotic assistance and mounting evidence of safety, without the need for catheter-based angiography. Rates of clinically significant hemorrhage, infection, and other complications appear lower with SEEG than with SDE implants. SEEG also avoids unnecessary craniotomies when seizures are localized to unresectable eloquent cortex, found to be multifocal or nonfocal, or ultimately treated with stereotactic procedures such as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), or deep brain stimulation (DBS). While SDE allows for excellent localization and functional mapping on the cortical surface, SEEG offers a less invasive option for sampling disparate brain areas, bilateral investigations, and deep or medial targets. SEEG has shown efficacy for seizure localization in the temporal lobe, the insula, lesional and nonlesional extra-temporal epilepsy, hypothalamic hamartomas, periventricular nodular heterotopias, and patients who have had prior craniotomies for resections or grids.

Furthermore, the lifestyle factors associated with super-cognition have not been studied adequately. The current study examined the cognitive profiles and lifestyle factors associated with super-cognition. Community-dwelling older adults (N = 693) were administered neuropsychological tests and self-reported measures of lifestyle factors at midlife (retrospectively recalled). Then, using an a priori set of criteria , we classified them as super-cognition or normal. A latent class analysis was conducted to examine the different cognitive profiles of super-cognition, and both groups were compared on their lifestyle-related outcomes. A total of 64 and 263 participants met the criteria for super-cognition and normal participants respectively. A three-class solution best described super-cognition among our participants. Approximately half of them had superior immediate memory; two other smaller groups of participants with super-cognition had superior attention, language, and visuospatial abilities. Participants with super-cognition reported less participation in social activities and, frequently, working more than 9 hours/day and feeling stressed, at midlife. Super-cognition among the elderly is associated with having a busier, more socially-isolated and stressful midlife.;,citation_author=Junhong Yu;,citation_author=Simon L Collinson;,citation_author=Tau Ming Liew;,citation_author=Tze Pin Ng;,citation_author=Rathi Mahendran;,citation_author=Ee Heok Kua;,citation_author=Lei Feng;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/23279095.2019.1570928;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/23279095.2019.1570928;,citation_issn=23279109;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=Appl.

Numerous mental health disorders are characterized by cognitive impairments that result in poor vocational and social outcomes. Among the cognitive domains commonly affected, working memory deficits have been noted in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Martinussen et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 44:377–384, 2005), post-traumatic stress disorder (Honzel et al. in Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci 14:792–804, 2014), and consistently with schizophrenia patients (Callicott et al. in Cereb Cortex 10:1078–1092, 2000; Lewis et al. in Front Hum Neurosci 10:85, 2005; Amann et al. in Brain Res Bull 83:147–161, 2010; Limongi et al. in Schizophr Res 197:386–391, 2018). Oscillations in neural activity from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are decomposed by frequency, and band-specific decreases in gamma power (\textgreater 30 Hz) have been correlated with working memory ability. This study examined within-subject changes in power of frequency-specific bands during sample versus choice trials during a spatial working memory paradigm (T-maze). EEG was recorded using a relatively novel wireless EEG telemetry system fully implanted within the mouse, enabling uninhibited movement during behavioral tasks. No significant differences were found between sample and correct choice phases in the alpha, theta or gamma frequency ranges. Evoked power was significantly higher during the choice phase than the sample phase in the high-beta/low-gamma frequency range. This frequency range has been implicated in the propagation of cortical predictions to lower levels of stimuli encoding in a top-down hierarchical manner. Results suggest there is an increase in brain activity during correct trials when the mouse enters the opposite arm during the choice phase compared to the sample phase, likely due to prediction error resulting from a discrepancy between present and prior experience.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Habitual coffee consumption and cognitive function: A Mendelian randomization meta-analysis in up to 415,530 participants;,citation_abstract=© 2018 The Author(s). Coffee’s long-term effect on cognitive function remains unclear with studies suggesting both benefits and adverse effects. We used Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal relationship between habitual coffee consumption and cognitive function in mid-to later life. This included up to 415, 530 participants and 300,760 coffee drinkers from 10 meta-analysed European ancestry cohorts. In each cohort, composite cognitive scores that capture global cognition and memory were computed using available tests. A genetic score derived using CYP1A1/2 (rs2472297) and AHR (rs6968865) was chosen as a proxy for habitual coffee consumption. Null associations were observed when examining the associations of the genetic score with global and memory cognition (β =-0.0007, 95% C.I.-0.009 to 0.008, P = 0.87; β =-0.001, 95% C.I.-0.005 to 0.002, P = 0.51, respectively), with high consistency between studies (Pheterogeneity \textgreater 0.4 for both). Domain specific analyses using available cognitive measures in the UK Biobank also did not support effects by habitual coffee intake for reaction time, pairs matching, reasoning or prospective memory (P ≥ 0.05 for all). Despite the power to detect very small effects, our meta-analysis provided no evidence for causal long-term effects of habitual coffee consumption on global cognition or memory.;,citation_author=Ang Zhou;,citation_author=Amy E.

Health risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) and serum cholesterol are associated with many common diseases. It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. We develop and apply a method (called GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian randomization analysis using summary-level data from genome-wide association studies to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height, and years of schooling (EduYears) with common diseases (sample sizes of up to 405,072). We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimer’s disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g., higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect of T2D on BMI is negative).;,citation_author=Zhihong Zhu;,citation_author=Zhili Zheng;,citation_author=Futao Zhang;,citation_author=Yang Wu;,citation_author=Maciej Trzaskowski;,citation_author=Robert Maier;,citation_author=Matthew R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Integration of summary data from GWAS and eQTL studies predicts complex trait gene targets;,citation_abstract=© 2016 Nature America, Inc. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with human complex traits. However, the genes or functional DNA elements through which these variants exert their effects on the traits are often unknown. We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation.;,citation_author=Zhihong Zhu;,citation_author=Futao Zhang;,citation_author=Han Hu;,citation_author=Andrew Bakshi;,citation_author=Matthew R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multi-level genomic analyses suggest new genetic variants involved in human memory;,citation_abstract=Development of high-throughput genotyping platforms provides an opportunity to identify new genetic elements related to complex cognitive functions. Taking advantage of multi-level genomic analysis, here we studied the genetic basis of human short-term (STM, n = 1623) and long-term (LTM, n = 1522) memory functions. Heritability estimation based on single nucleotide polymorphism showed moderate (61%, standard error 35%) heritability of short-term memory but almost zero heritability of long-term memory. We further performed a two-step genome-wide association study, but failed to find any SNPs that could pass genome-wide significance and survive replication at the same time. However, suggestive significance for rs7011450 was found in the shared component of the two STM tasks. Further inspections on its nearby gene zinc finger and at-hook domain containing and SNPs around this gene showed suggestive association with STM. In LTM, a polymorphism within branched chain amino acid transaminase 2 showed suggestive significance in the discovery cohort and has been replicated in another independent population of 1862. Furthermore, we performed a pathway analysis based on the current genomic data and found pathways including mTOR signaling and axon guidance significantly associated with STM capacity.

The extent to which multiple modifiable risk factors among children and families influence juvenile criminal conviction in an LMIC remains unexplored; however, it is necessary to identify prevention targets. This study examined the association between 22 modifiable individual and family exposures assessed in childhood (5–14&nbsp;years, n = 2511) and criminal conviction at a 7-year follow-up (13–21&nbsp;years, n = 1905, 76% retention rate) in a cohort of young people in Brazil. Population attributable risk fraction (PARF) was computed for significant risk factors. Criminal convictions were reported for 81 (4.3%) youths. Although most children living in poverty did not present criminal conviction (89 %), poverty at baseline was the only modifiable risk factor significantly associated with crime (OR 4.14, 99.8% CI 1.38–12.46) with a PARF of 22.5% (95% CI 5.9–36.1%). It suggests that preventing children’s exposure to poverty would reduce nearly a quarter of subsequent criminal convictions. These findings highlight the importance of poverty in criminal conviction, as it includes several deprivations and suggest that poverty eradication interventions during childhood may be crucial for reducing crime among Brazilian youth.;,citation_author=Carolina Ziebold;,citation_author=Sara Evans-Lacko;,citation_author=Mário César Rezende Andrade;,citation_author=Maurício Scopel Hoffmann;,citation_author=Lais Fonseca;,citation_author=Matheus Ghossain Barbosa;,citation_author=Pedro Mario Pan;,citation_author=Euripedes Miguel;,citation_author=Rodrigo Affonseca Bressan;,citation_author=Luis Augusto Rohde;,citation_author=Giovanni Abrahão Salum;,citation_author=Jair Jesus Mari;,citation_author=Ary Gadelha;,citation_publication_date=2022-08-04;,citation_cover_date=2022-08-04;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13975-8;,citation_issue=1, 1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41598-022-13975-8;,citation_issn=2045-2322;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sci Rep;,citation_publisher=Nature Publishing Group;">

<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults presents a significant challenge in clinical practice due to its complex presentation, high comorbidity, and the varying responses to treatment. Clinicians, patients, and stakeholders must navigate several decisional dilemmas when diagnosing and treating ADHD in adults. Here, we address the key decisional dilemmas and current controversies and challenges in diagnosing ADHD in adults.</p>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. While it is commonly diagnosed in children, ADHD frequently persists into adulthood, presenting unique challenges for diagnosis and management. This section explores the key decisional dilemmas faced by clinicians, patients, and stakeholders in diagnosing and treating adult ADHD.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trajectory-of-adhd-across-development">Trajectory of ADHD across development</h3>
<p>ADHD typically presents early in life, most often diagnosed and treated between early childhood and adolescence. Less commonly, ADHD can insidiously emerge in adulthood in individuals with no history of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity in childhood. Notably, longitudinal data from the MTA ADHD Treatment Study suggests 90-95% of “adult-onset ADHD” is better accounted for by comorbid psychopathology, personality disorders, and/or substance use disorders <em>misdiagnosed</em> as ADHD <span class="citation" data-cites="sibley2017">(<a href="#ref-sibley2017" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sibley2017?</strong></a>)</span>. The later-onset expression of ADHD thus appears to be a syndrome distinct from childhood-onset ADHD.</p>

<section id="executive-dysfunction-in-emerging-adulthood" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-dysfunction-in-emerging-adulthood">Executive dysfunction in emerging adulthood</h3>
<p>Seeking evaluation and treatment for ADHD <em>for the first time</em> continues to increase, and is especially salient on college campuses, where the use/misuse of prescription stimulant medication as a cognitive-enhancing drug is rising faster than the actual incidence of the disorder <span class="citation" data-cites="benson2015">(<a href="#ref-benson2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>benson2015?</strong></a>)</span>. The volume of college students seeking an evaluation for ADHD to obtain test-taking and other academic accommodations has increased in parallel.</p>
<p>Critically, interconnected heteromodal networks of association cortex that control higher executive cognitive functions are still maturing during college <span class="citation" data-cites="sydnorNeurodevelopmentAssociationCortices2021">(<a href="#ref-sydnorNeurodevelopmentAssociationCortices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Sydnor et al. 2021</a>)</span>. It is therefore plausible that generalized <em>executive dysfunction</em>, not undiagnosed ADHD per se, is underlying most clinical referrals for ADHD in college students. As such, we posit executive dysfunction is at the core of the real-world problems facing college students who self-refer for ADHD evaluation and treatment, which accentuates the comorbid difficulties these students face such as problematic drug and alcohol use, emotional dysregulation, and school failure.</p>

<p>Independent of when symptoms first present, the proliferation of adult-onset ADHD, whether real or feigned, signifies an increase in the demand to evaluate and treat ADHD across the lifespan. However, <em>clinicians do not have evidence-based, objective psychodiagnostic tools</em> (e.g., rating scales, neuropsychological measures) available to evaluate ADHD/EF in this specific population <em>that grows each year</em>. Poor diagnostic tools lead to inaccurate and misleading conclusions, which can result in clinicians making wasteful/cost-ineffective, inappropriate, or potentially even harmful treatment recommendations. If we fail to implement clinical assessment tools sensitive to <em>symptom validity</em> and <em>performance validity</em> during evaluations, we will continue to <em>overdiagnose</em> and treat college students and adults from the community faking ADHD for secondary gain, and <em>underdiagnose</em> those with actual ADHD who need medical and/or academic intervention.</p>

<p>ADHD remains improperly diagnosed and treated in tens of thousands of promising college students, younger adults, and older adults. The consequences of aberrant diagnosis and treatment of ADHD during this critical stage of emerging adulthood and beyond can lead to functional impairments in school/work performance, educational attainment, career development, social-emotional development, and family and community life. The need for evidence-based diagnostic tools specific to this rapidly growing clinical population is urgently stronger than ever.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="controversies-and-challenges">Controversies and Challenges</h2>
<p>Diagnosing ADHD in adults is inherently challenging. Symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity often overlap with other psychiatric conditions, making differential diagnosis difficult. Clinicians must consider the chronicity of symptoms from childhood through adulthood and assess functional impairment in various settings <span class="citation" data-cites="culpepper2008">(<a href="#ref-culpepper2008" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>culpepper2008?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different Practices</strong>: There is significant variability in diagnostic practices. While some clinicians use structured diagnostic interviews and validated rating scales, others rely on clinical judgment. This inconsistency can lead to both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis of ADHD <span class="citation" data-cites="culpepper2008">(<a href="#ref-culpepper2008" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>culpepper2008?</strong></a>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Criteria</strong>: There is debate over whether the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD, primarily developed for children, are fully applicable to adults <span class="citation" data-cites="asherson2016">(<a href="#ref-asherson2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>asherson2016?</strong></a>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Overdiagnosis vs.&nbsp;Underdiagnosis</strong>: Controversy exists over the extent to which ADHD is overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed in adult populations <span class="citation" data-cites="faraone2021">(<a href="#ref-faraone2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>faraone2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Differences</strong>: The diagnosis of ADHD in women may be underrepresented due to differences in symptom presentation and societal expectations <span class="citation" data-cites="quinn2014">(<a href="#ref-quinn2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>quinn2014?</strong></a>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Comorbidity</strong>: High rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders complicate the diagnosis of ADHD in adults <span class="citation" data-cites="kessler2006">(<a href="#ref-kessler2006" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>kessler2006?</strong></a>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Criteria and Symptom Manifestation</strong>: Adult ADHD diagnosis is complicated by the persistence and transformation of symptoms from childhood. Symptoms such as inattention and impulsivity may persist, while hyperactivity may manifest differently in adults.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Criteria Adaptation</strong>: Current diagnostic criteria (e.g., DSM-5) are based primarily on childhood symptoms, which may not fully capture adult presentations. There is a need for criteria that reflect adult-specific symptoms and impairments.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The accurate diagnosis of ADHD in adults presents several decisional dilemmas for clinicians and patients. These include the adaptation of diagnostic criteria, the use of standardized tools, consideration of comorbidities, and the hard truth that many individuals are blatantly feigning their symptoms.</p>
