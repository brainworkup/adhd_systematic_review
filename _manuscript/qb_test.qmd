The research report identified several limitations in the accuracy of the QbTestÂ® for diagnosing adult ADHD:

1. **Low Discriminative Power**: The QbTest has a low ability to distinguish between ADHD and other psychiatric disorders, with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of only 0.65.

2. **Sensitivity and Specificity Issues**: The sensitivity is about 68% at a specificity of 48%, indicating a high rate of false positives.

3. **Limited Utility in Complex Cases**: The test may not perform well in cases with multiple comorbidities or unclear ADHD presentations, as it was primarily validated in straightforward cases.

4. **Variability in Results**: Results can vary significantly based on the population tested, making it less effective in heterogeneous samples.

5. **Dependence on Clinical Context**: The QbTest is meant to complement clinical interviews and other diagnostic tools, rather than serve as a standalone measure.

6. **Age and Gender Factors**: The test may not adequately account for variations in ADHD symptoms based on age and gender, affecting diagnostic accuracy across different demographic groups.
