    "\n",
    "## DOMAIN 1: PATIENT SELECTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Low Risk Criteria: - Consecutive or random sampling explicitly documented - Case-control design avoided or appropriately justified - Inappropriate exclusions avoided - Clear documentation of recruitment strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Unclear Risk Indicators: - Insufficient description of sampling methodology - Ambiguous selection criteria - Limited documentation of recruitment process - Unclear timeline of participant enrollment\n",
    "\n",
    "High Risk Markers: - Non-consecutive or non-random sampling - Inappropriate case-control design - Inappropriate exclusions affecting representativeness - Substantial selection bias evident\n",
    "\n",
    "DOMAIN 2: INDEX TEST Low Risk Criteria: - Test conducted according to standardized protocol - Threshold pre-specified - Test interpreters blinded to reference standard - Clear documentation of test administration\n",
    "\n",
    "DOMAIN 3: REFERENCE STANDARD Low Risk Criteria: - DSM-5/ICD-10 criteria properly implemented - Reference standard results interpreted blind to index test - Standardized diagnostic protocol followed - Multi-informant data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "DOMAIN 4: FLOW AND TIMING Low Risk Criteria: - Appropriate interval between index test and reference standard - All participants receive same reference standard - All participants included in analysis - Clear documentation of assessment timeline\n",
