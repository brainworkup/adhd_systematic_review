METHODS: The utility of the QbTest+ was investigated in a clinical cohort of 69 adult patients referred to a specialist ADHD clinic in the UK. RESULTS: Scores from the QbTest+ failed to differentiate between patients diagnosed with ADHD and those who did not receive a diagnosis after full clinical assessment.

C.","Utility of the Personality Assessment Inventory in detecting feigned Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): The Feigned Adult ADHD index","OBJECTIVE: The high potential for secondary gain among college students presenting for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) evaluations highlights the need for psychometrically sound embedded validity indicators. The purpose of this study was to develop new validity indicators specific to feigned ADHD for the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and compare them to preexisting imbedded PAI validity measures. METHOD: PAI scales that were theoretically related to feigned ADHD were evaluated. A binomial (ADHD simulators, n = 138, and genuine ADHD, n = 142) logistic regression was conducted with selected PAI scales and subscales. Classification rates were compared between the new and existing validity scales. A similar approach was used for item-level data in a second study in a subgroup of the original sample. RESULTS: The derived PAI scale-based logistic regression had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 92%. This algorithm accurately identified 97% of healthy controls as not feigning ADHD and correctly identified 98% of a no diagnosis group and 75% of a mood/anxiety disorders group. Classification accuracy of the new index was superior to the majority of existing PAI validity scales across groups. An item-level PAI algorithm had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97% for identifying feigned ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: New validity measures were compared to existing PAI validity indicators and performed better than many of them in this study. The algorithms developed in this study of ADHD simulators and genuine ADHD cases have adequate sensitivity and good specificity and appear to function differently than other PAI symptom validity scales.",,29186287,,"Psychology Department, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.

A., Newberg, A.","SPECT Functional Neuroimaging Distinguishes Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder From Healthy Controls in Big Data Imaging Cohorts","Background: The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) relies on history and observation, as no reliable biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we compared a large single diagnosis group of patients with ADHD (combined, inattentive, and hyperactive) to healthy controls using brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to determine specific brain regions which could serve as potential biomarkers to reliably distinguish ADHD. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, subjects (n = 1,135) were obtained from a large multisite psychiatric database, where resting state (baseline) and on-task SPECT scans were obtained. Only baseline scans were analyzed in the present study. Subjects were separated into two groups - Group 1 (n = 1,006) was composed of patients who only met criteria for ADHD with no comorbid diagnoses, while a control group (n = 129) composed of individuals who did not meet criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis, brain injury, or substance use served as a non-matched control. SPECT regions of interests (ROIs) and visual readings were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Predicted probabilities from this analysis were inputted into a Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis to identify sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: The baseline ROIs and visual readings show significant separations from healthy controls. Sensitivity of the visual reads was 100% while specificity was >97%. The sensitivity and specificity of the post-hoc ROI analysis were both 100%. Decreased perfusion was primarily seen in the orbitofrontal cortices, anterior cingulate gyri, areas of the prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes. In addition, ROI analysis revealed some unexpected areas with predictive value in distinguishing ADHD, such as cerebellar subregions and portions of the temporal lobes. Conclusions: Brain perfusion SPECT distinguishes adult ADHD patients without comorbidities from healthy controls. Areas which were highly significantly different from control and thus may serve as biomarkers in baseline SPECT scans included: medial anterior prefrontal cortex, left anterior temporal lobe, and right insular cortex. Future studies of these potential biomarkers in ADHD patients with comorbidities are warranted.",,34899414,,"Amen Clinics, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA, United States.

This study compared the screeners based upon the Fourth and Fifth edition of the Manual. One hundred and forty patients, including seventy with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, completed both screeners, independent from a clinical diagnostic interview. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated based on four different scoring methods: a categorical score of three or four positive answers, and a dimensional score of twelve or fourteen. Both screening instruments appeared to perform equally without significant differences between them, no matter which scoring system was used. However, the only satisfactory result was obtained using the dimensional scoring with a cutoff of 12, providing a sensitivity and negative predictive value above 80%.

Participants performed the MOXO-d-CPT and an established performance validity test (PVT). Second, the MOXO-d-CPT classification accuracy, employed in Phase 1, was retrospectively compared with archival data of 47 ADHD patients and age-matched healthy controls. Results: Simulators performed significantly worse on all MOXO-d-CPT indices than healthy controls and ADHD patients. Three MOXO-d-CPT indices (attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) and a scale combining these indices showed adequate discriminative capacity.

V.","Diagnostic utility of brain activity flow patterns analysis in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","BACKGROUND: A previous small study suggested that Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel ERP-based brain network analysis, may have diagnostic utility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we examined the diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a larger population of adults with and without ADHD. METHOD: Subjects were unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a response inhibition task (Go/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed into a machine learning algorithm. RESULTS: The BNA analysis of the EEG data recorded during the Go/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for the NoGo condition). CONCLUSIONS: BNA methodology can help differentiate between ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective evaluation of electrophysiological changes associated with ADHD.

Neuropsychological tests like continuous performance tests (CPT) try to solve this dilemma by objectively measurable parameters. We investigated in a cohort of n=114 patients presenting to an ADHD outpatient clinic how well a commercially available CPT test (QbTest(Â®)) can differentiate between patients with ADHD (n=94) and patients with a disconfirmed ADHD diagnosis (n=20). Both groups showed numerous comorbidities, predominantly depression (27.2% in the ADHD group vs. 45% in the non-ADHD group) and substance-use disorders (18.1% vs. 10%, respectively). Patients with ADHD showed significant higher activity (2.07 Â± 1.23) than patients without ADHD (1.34 Â± 1.27, dF=112; p=0.019), whereas for the other core parameters, inattention and impulsivity no differences could be found. Reaction time variability has been discussed as a typical marker for inattention in ADHD. Therefore, we investigated how well ex-Gaussian analysis of response time can differentiate between ADHD and other patients, showing, that it does not help to identify patients with ADHD. Even though patients with ADHD showed significantly higher activity, this parameter differed only poorly between patients (accuracy AUC 65% of an ROC-Curve). We conclude that CPTs do not help to identify patients with ADHD in a specialized outpatient clinic. The usability of this test for differentiating between ADHD and other psychiatric disorders is poor and a sophisticated analysis of reaction time did not decisively increase the test accuracy.",,32265761,,"Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

We searched for a neuroanatomical signature associated with ADHD spectrum symptoms in adults by applying, for the first time, machine learning-based pattern classification methods to structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from stimulant-naÃ¯ve adults with childhood-onset ADHD and healthy controls (HC). METHOD: Sixty-seven ADHD patients and 66 HC underwent high-resolution T1-weighted and DTI acquisitions. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a non-linear kernel was applied on multimodal image features extracted on regions of interest placed across the whole brain. RESULTS: The discrimination between a mixed-gender ADHD subgroup and individually matched HC (n = 58 each) yielded area-under-the-curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy (DA) values of up to 0.71% and 66% (P = 0.003) respectively. AUC and DA values increased to 0.74% and 74% (P = 0.0001) when analyses were restricted to males (52 ADHD vs. 44 HC).

M., Bolinger, E., Suhr, J.","Further Validation of the Conner's Adult Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Rating Scale Infrequency Index (CII) for Detection of Non-Credible Report of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms","OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be easily presented in a non-credible manner, through non-credible report of ADHD symptoms and/or by non-credible performance on neuropsychological tests. While most studies have focused on detection of non-credible performance using performance validity tests, there are few studies examining the ability to detect non-credible report of ADHD symptoms. We provide further validation data for a recently developed measure of non-credible ADHD symptom report, the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) Infrequency Index (CII). METHOD: Using archival data from 86 adults referred for concerns about ADHD, we examined the accuracy of the CII in detecting extreme scores on the CAARS and invalid reporting on validity indices of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Format (MMPI-2-RF). We also examined the accuracy of the CII in detecting non-credible performance on standalone and embedded performance validity tests. RESULTS: The CII was 52% sensitive to extreme scores on CAARS DSM symptom subscales (with 97% specificity) and 20%-36% sensitive to invalid responding on MMPI-2-RF validity scales (with near 90% specificity), providing further evidence for the interpretation of the CII as an indicator of non-credible ADHD symptom report. However, the CII detected only 18% of individuals who failed a standalone performance validity test (Word Memory Test), with 87.8% specificity, and was not accurate in detecting non-credible performance using embedded digit span cutoffs.

S.","The ADHD Symptom Infrequency Scale (ASIS): A novel measure designed to detect adult ADHD simulators","The current project outlines the development of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptom Infrequency Scale (ASIS), a stand-alone measure designed to identify individuals feigning or exaggerating symptoms to receive a diagnosis of ADHD. Over the course of 3 studies, valid data was collected from 402 participants assigned to control, simulator, ADHD diagnosed, or possible undiagnosed ADHD groups. Group assignment was based on self-reported history of ADHD diagnosis including information about the credentials of diagnosing professional and methods used. The ASIS includes an Infrequency Scale (INF) designed to detect rarely reported symptoms of ADHD and several clinical scales designed to measure genuine symptoms. The final version of the ASIS demonstrated high internal consistency for the INF (Î± = .96) and the ADHD Total scales (Î±= .96). Convergent validity for the ADHD Total was established through a strong correlation with Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (r = .92). Initial validation of the INF yielded high discriminability between groups (d = 2.76; 95% confidence interval [2.17, 3.36]). The final INF scale demonstrated strong sensitivity (.79-.86) and excellent specificity (.89). Using our study's malingering base rate of 29%, positive and negative predictive values were strong (.71-.79 and .92-.93, respectively). Additional information is provided for a range of base rates. Current results suggest that the ASIS has potential as a reliable and valid measure of ADHD that is sensitive to malingering when compared to a sample of individuals self-reporting a history of ADHD diagnosis.

R.","The utility of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening instruments in individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorders","OBJECTIVE: Several screening tools for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been validated in non-substance-abusing populations, but limited data are available regarding their utility in adults with current substance use disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 3 commonly used ADHD screening instruments in cocaine-dependent individuals. METHOD: Adults seeking treatment for cocaine dependence (N = 102) were administered 3 self-report instruments between May 2009 and April 2011: the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS), the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 (ASRS-V1.1). They then met with master's-level clinicians who administered the Conners Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID). With the CAADID serving as the gold standard, the validity of the screening instruments was determined, both singly and in combination. RESULTS: Twenty-five (25%) of the 102 patients met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD or ADHD not otherwise specified (NOS) based on the CAADID. Kappa scores determining agreement between the screening tools and the CAADID (with ADHD NOS labeled as ADHD or labeled as not ADHD) ranged from 0.37 to 0.69. Sensitivity scores for the broadest range of ADHD cases were 80.0%, 87.5%, and 60.9% for the CAARS, WURS, and ASRS-V1.1, respectively. Positive predictive value was highest for the CAARS, at 74.1%, and negative predictive value was highest for the WURS, at 95.1%. The highest sensitivity (96.0%) was found with coadministration of the WURS and CAARS. CONCLUSION: While all of the screening instruments were found to have adequate sensitivity and specificity, the CAARS outperformed the other instruments in regard to agreement with the CAADID and positive predictive values. However, the WURS, with the highest sensitivity in regard to the broadest range of ADHD cases, may be the single best instrument for preliminary screening purposes. Further, because the ASRS-V1.1 is the simplest and shortest instrument to administer, it may have advantages when a large number of patients need to be screened.",,23218166,,"New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, 1051 Riverside Dr, Unit 66, New York, NY 10032, USA. dakware@nyspi.columbia.edu",,,,,NLM,Nov,"2024-08-02 17:28:24","2024-08-02 17:28:24",10.4088/JCP.12m07895,2012/12/12,,"0160-6689 (Print) 0160-6689",11,"J Clin Psychiatry","Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/rehabilitation Cocaine-Related Disorders/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/rehabilitation Comorbidity Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/epidemiology/rehabilitation Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Female Humans *Interview, Psychological Male Mass Screening/*statistics & numerical data Personality Inventory/*statistics & numerical data Psychometrics/statistics & numerical data Reproducibility of Results Retinitis Pigmentosa",eng,"Pubmed May 28 2024","NIHMS455145 and has received medication from US World Meds for a National Institutes of Healthâfunded study.

","Dunlop, B. W., Wu, R., Helms, K.","Performance of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-v1.1 in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an under-recognized comorbid disorder among patients with mood disorders. ADHD is an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior and contributes to many aspects of impaired function in adults. Diagnosis of ADHD in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients is challenging due to the overlap in cognitive symptoms between the two disorders. The ADHD Self-Report Scale, version 1.1 (ASRS-v1.1) is a widely used screening instrument for ADHD in adults but its accuracy has not been evaluated previously in treatment-seeking MDD patients. We administered the ASRS-v1.1 to 55 healthy controls and 40 adults with a primary psychiatric diagnosis of MDD who were participating in clinical research studies. ADHD diagnosis was assessed via structured interview with the adult ADHD module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus version 6.0.0 (MINI) along with a psychiatrist's assessment. Overall, full-syndrome ADHD was diagnosed in 12.5% of the MDD patients. MDD patients endorsed all 18 items of the ASRS-v1.1 more frequently than the healthy controls and the number of ASRS-v1.1 items endorsed correlated with levels of anxiety in the MDD patients. The ASRS-v1.1 demonstrated fair performance for identifying full syndrome DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis, with sensitivity 60%, specificity: 68.6%, positive predictive value 21.4%, negative predictive value 92.3% and total classification accuracy of 67.5%. Positive predictive value improved substantially when the ADHD criterion requiring symptom onset before age 7 was omitted. In adult MDD patients, a negative ASRS-v1.1 screen strongly suggests the absence of ADHD but positive screen results require careful evaluation to determine whether self-reported ADHD symptoms simply emerge from depression or whether comorbid ADHD is present.",,29596328,,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Emory University, 12 Executive Park Drive, 3rd Floor, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. bdunlop@emory.edu.

","Edebol, H., Helldin, L., Norlander, T.","Objective Measures of Behavior Manifestations in Adult ADHD and Differentiation from Participants with Bipolar II Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Participants with Disconfirmed ADHD as Well as Normative Participants","BACKGROUND: The present study evaluated two psychometric instruments derived from the objective measurement of adult ADHD using the Quantified Behavior Test Plus. The instruments were examined in ADHD versus a clinical group with overlapping symptoms including borderline personality disorder and bipolar II disorder, and another clinical group with participants assessed for but disconfirmed a diagnosis of ADHD as well as adult normative participants. METHODS: The Quantified Behavior Test Plus includes Continuous Performance Testing and a Motion Tracking System with parameters related to attention and activity operationalized as the cardinal symptoms of ADHD and then summarized into a Weighed Core Symptoms scale with ten cut-points ranging from 0 to 100. A categorical predictor variable called Prediction of ADHD was used to examine the levels of sensitivity and specificity for the Quantified Behavior Test Plus with regard to ADHD. RESULTS: The Weighed Core Symptoms scale separated ADHD and normative participants from each other as well as from the two clinical reference groups. The scale reported highest levels of core symptoms in the ADHD group and the lowest level of core symptoms in the normative group. Analyses with Prediction of ADHD yielded 85 % specificity for the normative group, 87 % sensitivity for the ADHD group, 36 % sensitivity for the bipolar II and borderline group and 41 % sensitivity for the group with a disconfirmed diagnosis of ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The Weighed Core Symptoms scale facilitated objective assessment of adult ADHD insofar that the ADHD group presented more core symptoms than the other two clinical groups and the normative group. Sensitivity for the Quantified Behavior Test Plus was lower in complex clinical groups with Bipolar II disorder, Borderline disorder and in patients with a disconfirmed diagnosis of ADHD.

D., Kooij, S., Thorell, L., Christiansen, H.","Assessing ADHD symptoms in children and adults: evaluating the role of objective measures","BACKGROUND: Diagnostic guidelines recommend using a variety of methods to assess and diagnose ADHD. Applying subjective measures always incorporates risks such as informant biases or large differences between ratings obtained from diverse sources. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ratings and tests seem to assess somewhat different constructs. The use of objective measures might thus yield valuable information for diagnosing ADHD. This study aims at evaluating the role of objective measures when trying to distinguish between individuals with ADHD and controls. Our sample consisted of children (nâ=â60) and adults (nâ=â76) diagnosed with ADHD and matched controls who completed self- and observer ratings as well as objective tasks. Diagnosis was primarily based on clinical interviews. A popular pattern recognition approach, support vector machines, was used to predict the diagnosis. RESULTS: We observed relatively high accuracy of 79% (adults) and 78% (children) applying solely objective measures. Predicting an ADHD diagnosis using both subjective and objective measures exceeded the accuracy of objective measures for both adults (89.5%) and children (86.7%), with the subjective variables proving to be the most relevant. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that objective measures are more robust against rater bias and errors inherent in subjective measures and may be more replicable. Considering the high accuracy of objective measures only, we found in our study, we think that they should be incorporated in diagnostic procedures for assessing ADHD.",,29776429,,"Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, Department of Psychology, Philipps University Marburg, Gutenbergstr. 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany.

","Galloway-Long, H., Huang-Pollock, C., Neely, K.","Ahead of the (ROC) Curve: A Statistical Approach to Utilizing Ex-Gaussian Parameters of Reaction Time in Diagnosing ADHD Across Three Developmental Periods","INTRODUCTION: Performance on executive function (EF) tasks is only modestly predictive of a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), despite the common assumption that EF deficits are ubiquitous to the disorder. The current study sought to determine whether ex-Gaussian parameters of simple reaction time are better able to discriminate between children and adults with and without ADHD, compared with traditional measures of inhibitory control. METHODS: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to examine the ability of performance on two commonly used tasks of inhibitory control (i.e. stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and go-no-go tasks) to predict ADHD status in preschool (N = 108), middle childhood (N = 309), and young adulthood (N = 133). RESULTS: Across all samples, SSRT, go-no-go percentage of failed inhibits, and standard deviation of reaction (SDRT) time to ""go"" trials, all successfully discriminated between individuals with and without ADHD. Ex-Gaussian decomposition of the RT distribution indicated that both larger tau and larger sigma drove findings for SDRT. Contrary to predictions, traditional measures of inhibitory control were equal if not better predictors of ADHD status than ex-Gaussian parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support ongoing work to quantify the separate contributions of cognitive subprocesses that drive task performance, which in turn is critical to developing and improving process-based approaches in clinical assessment.",,34488917,,"Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.

Many items reflect emotional dysregulation. Although over 30 publications have examined its psychometric properties, reliance on non-clinical samples has limited conclusions from these reports, as have sub-optimal statistical approaches in most previous publications. None compared the full WURS to the abbreviated WURS-25. We evaluated both versions with adults presenting for treatment: 137 with ADHD and 230 with GAD or MDD, along with 120 normal controls. Factor analysis was performed on the full WURS using the clinical cohorts. The WURS versions were compared using ANOVA, logistic regression, ROC and confusion matrices. Consistent with two previous reports, the full WURS generated five factors: Disruptive mood & behavior, ADHD, Anxiety/dysphoria, Social and Academic. The ADHD factor correlated rÂ >Â 0.8 with the Disruptive mood/behavior and the Academic factor. ADHD patients scored higher than GAD/MDD subjects (pÂ <Â .001) on the Disruptive mood & behavior, ADHD, and Academic factors. The WURS-25 produced good separation of ADHD subjects from normal controls with ROC (AUCÂ =Â 0.974) and logistic regression (SensitivityÂ =Â 91%, SpecificityÂ =Â 92%).

Also, the lack of clarity regarding the recruitment process and the potential for circular reasoning further undermine the study's reliability.","Narrow eligibility criteria","The study population includes participants with distinct diagnostic categories (ADHD, MDD/GAD, and non-clinical controls), but it appears highly selected. For example, the ADHD group represents a specific subset of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, excluding broader or ambiguous cases, and the non-clinical controls likely lack complex or comorbid conditions that are common in real-world populations. This selection limits the generalizability of the findings, as the population does not reflect the broader community where ADHD often coexists with multiple comorbidities or occurs in diverse demographic and clinical contexts.","Test not used as common in current practice","The Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS) and its shorter version (WURS-25) are specific tools for retrospective evaluation of ADHD symptoms, but they are not widely used as the primary diagnostic instruments in current clinical practice.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used to assess differences in rating scale scores between clinical (nÂ =Â 52) and control (nÂ =Â 74) samples as well as differences among subgroups of the clinical sample (22 ADHD; 16 ADHDÂ +Â ANX; 14 ANX). METHOD: Participants completed an online questionnaire where they responded to the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS; Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, ) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory scales (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, ). RESULTS: Results showed that the CAARS and STAI had limited sensitivity and specificity and may lack in ability to differentially diagnose ADHD and/or ANX. Cluster analysis was used to guide the proposal of modifications for the two scales, which were to use inattentive items only for the CAARS and to exclude state ANX-present items on the STAI for use in differential diagnosis. Further parametric analysis supported these proposed modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be made aware of the limitations of the CAARS and STAI scales in terms of specificity, when used to inform differential diagnosis of ADHD and ANX. Further analysis on the psychometric properties of these modified scales is needed in order to confirm that they are valid and reliable scales. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Clinical implications It is possible that widely used self-report rating scales are not valid for use in the context of assessing adult ADHD when ANX is present. Clinicians should take alternative approaches to measuring ADHD symptoms in the context of ANX. Findings of the present study suggest the use of inattentive items only for the CAARS and to exclude state ANX-present items on the STAI for differential diagnostic use. Limitations of the study The sample sizes of the clinical subgroups were relatively small. Diagnoses were not confirmed using a semi-structured clinical interview.

L., Gillott, A., Hollis, C.","The incremental validity of a computerised assessment added to clinical rating scales to differentiate adult ADHD from autism spectrum disorder","There is a clinical need for objective evidence-based measures that are sensitive and specific to ADHD when compared with other neurodevelopmental disorders. This study evaluated the incremental validity of adding an objective measure of activity and computerised cognitive assessment to clinical rating scales to differentiate adult ADHD from Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Adults with ADHD (n=33) or ASD (n=25) performed the QbTest, comprising a Continuous Performance Test with motion-tracker to record physical activity. QbTest parameters measuring inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity were combined to provide a summary score ('QbTotal'). Binary stepwise logistic regression measured the probability of assignment to the ADHD or ASD group based on scores on the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale-subscale E (CAARS-E) and Autism Quotient (AQ10) in the first step and then QbTotal added in the second step. The model fit was significant at step 1 (CAARS-E, AQ10) with good group classification accuracy. These predictors were retained and QbTotal was added, resulting in a significant improvement in model fit and group classification accuracy. All predictors were significant. ROC curves indicated superior specificity of QbTotal. The findings present preliminary evidence that adding QbTest to clinical rating scales may improve the differentiation of ADHD and ASD in adults.",,27400220,,"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Triumph Road, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK.

P., Walitza, S., Gerlach, M., Schmitt, A.","Pilot study: potential transcription markers for adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in whole blood","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioural disorder that affects not only children and adolescents but also adults; however, diagnosis of adult ADHD is difficult because patients seem to have reduced externalized behaviour. ADHD is a multifactorial disorder in which many genes, all with small effects, are thought to cause the disorder in the presence of unfavourable environmental conditions. Therefore, in this pilot study, we explored the expression profile of a list of previously established candidate genes in peripheral blood samples from adult ADHD subjects (n = 108) and compared these results with those of healthy controls (n = 35). We demonstrate that combining the gene expression levels of dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), dopamine D5 receptor, tryptophan hydroxylase-1, and SNAP25 as predictors in a regression model resulted in sensitivity and specificity of over 80 % (ROC: max R(2) = 0.587, AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001, 95 % CI: 0.900-0.985). In conclusion, the combination of these four genes could represent a potential method for estimating risk and could be of diagnostic value for ADHD.

J., Zangen, A.","Right prefrontal activation predicts ADHD and its severity: A TMS-EEG study in young adults","OBJECTIVE: Here we bring a neurophysiological diagnostic tool, based on pathophysiologically-relevant brain region, that is critical for reducing the variability between clinicians, and necessary for quantitative measures of ADHD severity. METHODS: 54 healthy and 57 ADHD adults participated in the study. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right prefrontal cortex and also recorded during the Stop Signal task. RESULTS: TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) and the event related potential (ERP) components in the Stop Signal task were found to be significantly reduced in ADHD relative to the matched healthy controls. Stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and stopping accuracy was found to correlate with the ERP signal, and ADHD severity correlated with the TEP signal. Cortical activity (early TEP and Stop Signal ERP) diagnostic model yielded accuracy of 72%. CONCLUSION: TEPs and ERPs reveal that right PFC excitability was associated with ADHD severity, and with behavioral impulsivity - as a hallmark of ADHD pathology. This electrophysiological biomarker supports the potential of objective diagnosis for ADHD. SIGNIFICANCE: Such tools would allow better assessment of treatment efficacy and prognosis, may advance understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and better the public's attitudes and stigma towards ADHD.

This article describes the development and initial validation of a new symptom validity measure designed to detect feigned or exaggerated ADHD symptom reporting. METHOD: Employing items from a commonly used self-report measure of ADHD (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale [CAARS]) and select items from a scale measuring symptoms of dissociation, we assessed students diagnosed with ADHD, students with other diagnoses, and student volunteers with no psychopathology. RESULTS: This new measure (Exaggeration Index or EI) demonstrated excellent specificity (.97) and adequate sensitivity (.24) in discriminating between those who are suspected of or instructed to feign or exaggerate symptoms of ADHD and all other clinical groups.

While the field of neuropsychology has identified that factors, such as effort and motivation, can significantly interfere with correct interpretation of self-reported symptoms and test scores, evaluation methods for other psychological conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have not addressed effort and motivation as potential factors influencing accurate diagnosis. In analyzing the performance of students simulating ADHD, and comparing it to performance of both non-ADHD and genuine ADHD students, this study clearly demonstrated that the symptoms of ADHD are easily fabricated, and that simulators would be indistinguishable from those with true ADHD.

T.","Discriminating malingered attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder from genuine symptom reporting using novel Personality Assessment Inventory validity measures","It is now widely understood that ADHD can be feigned easily and convincingly. Despite this, almost no methods exist to assist clinicians in identifying when such behavior occurs. Recently, new validity indicators specific to feigned ADHD were reported for the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Derived from a logistic regression, these algorithms are said to have excellent specificity and good sensitivity in identifying feigned ADHD. However, these authors compared those with genuine ADHD only to nonclinical undergraduate students (asked to respond honestly or asked to simulate ADHD); no criterion group of definite malingerers was included. We therefore investigated these new validity indicators with 331 postsecondary students who underwent assessment for possible ADHD and compared scores of those who were eventually diagnosed with ADHD (nâ=â111) to those who were not [Clinical controls (66), Definite malingerers (36); No diagnosis (117)]. The two proposed PAI algorithms were found to have poor positive predictive value (.19 and .17). Self-report validity measures from the Connors' Adult Attention Rating Scale, and the Negative Impression Management scale on the PAI returned more positive results.

T.","A provisional screening instrument for four common mental disorders in adult primary care patients","OBJECTIVE: To develop an adult self-report instrument for provisional diagnosis of four common mental disorders in primary care patients. METHODS: Primary care patients were evaluated during routine clinic visits with a self-report screening tool comprised of 85 DSM-IV symptom-based candidate questions. Patients with a physician-assessed provisional diagnosis for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive episode (MDE), past/present mania, and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or none of these, completed additional self-report clinical questionnaires, and then were interviewed on the telephone by a trained rater for a SCID/ACDS diagnosis. Responses to the symptom-based candidate questions were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity for a SCID/ACDS diagnosis (GAD, N = 24; MDE, N = 89; Mania, N = 24; ADHD, N = 65) and to select the optimal four questions for each diagnosis to be included in the instrument. RESULTS: Analyses resulted in a 17-item instrument for provisional differential diagnosis of GAD, MDE, past/present mania, and ADHD. Comparison of limited symptom-based versus full DSM-IV criteria-based diagnosis showed minimal differences for relative diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivities and specificities, respectively, were 83% and 75% for GAD, 80% and 80% for MDE, 83% and 82% for mania, and 82%and 73% for ADHD.

L.","Structure and diagnosis of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: analysis of expanded symptom criteria from the Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale","CONTEXT: Controversy exists about the appropriate criteria for a diagnosis of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the structure and symptoms most predictive of DSM-IV adult ADHD. DESIGN: The data are from clinical interviews in enriched subsamples of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (n = 131) and a survey of a large managed health care plan (n = 214). The physician-administered Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) was used to assess childhood ADHD and expanded symptoms of current adult ADHD. Analyses examined the stability of symptoms from childhood to adulthood, the structure of adult ADHD, and the adult symptoms most predictive of current clinical diagnoses. SETTING: The ACDS was administered telephonically by clinical research interviewers with extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD. PARTICIPANTS: An enriched sample of community respondents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnoses of DSM-IV /ACDS adult ADHD. RESULTS: Almost half of the respondents (45.7%) who had childhood ADHD continued to meet the full DSM-IV criteria for current adult ADHD, with 94.9% of these patients having current attention-deficit disorder and 34.6% having current hyperactivity disorder. Adult persistence was much greater for inattention than for hyperactivity/impulsivity. Additional respondents met the full criteria for current adult ADHD despite not having met the full childhood criteria. A 3-factor structure of adult symptoms included executive functioning (EF), inattention/hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Stepwise logistic regression found EF problems to be the most consistent and discriminating predictors of adult DSM-IV /ACDS ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings document the greater persistence of inattentive than of hyperactive/impulsive childhood symptoms of ADHD in adulthood but also show that inattention is not specific to ADHD because it is strongly associated with other adult mental disorders. In comparison, EF problems are more specific and consistently important predictors of DSM-IV adult ADHD despite not being in the DSM-IV, suggesting that the number of EF symptoms should be increased in the DSM-V/ICD-11.",,21041618,,"Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, 180 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115, USA. kessler@hcp.med.harvard.edu",,,,,NLM,Nov,"2024-08-02 17:28:29","2024-08-02 17:28:29",10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.146,2010/11/03,,"0003-990X (Print) 0003-990x",11,"Arch Gen Psychiatry","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology Child Data Collection/statistics & numerical data Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Factor Analysis, Statistical Female Health Status Humans Interviews as Topic/methods Logistic Models Male Predictive Value of Tests Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/*statistics & numerical data Psychometrics Severity of Illness Index Surveys and Questionnaires",eng,"Pubmed May 28 2024",NIHMS266485,"1538-3636 Kessler, Ronald C Green, Jennifer Greif Adler, Lenard A Barkley, Russell A Chatterji, Somnath Faraone, Stephen V Finkelman, Matthew Greenhill, Laurence L Gruber, Michael J Jewell, Mark Russo, Leo J Sampson, Nancy A Van Brunt, David L U01 MH060220/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States U01-MH60220/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

However, relatively little is known about functional connectivity in adult ADHD, and how it is linked with the heritability of ADHD. METHODS: We measured eyes-open and eyes-closed resting electroencephalography (EEG) from 38 adults with ADHD, 45 1st degree relatives of people with ADHD and 51 healthy controls. Functional connectivity among all scalp channels was calculated using a weighted phase lag index for delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. A machine learning analysis using penalized linear regression was used to identify if connectivity features (10,080 connectivity pairs) could predict ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, we examined if EEG connectivity could accurately classify participants into ADHD, 1st degree relatives and/or control groups. RESULTS: Hyperactive symptoms were best predicted by eyes-open EEG connectivity in delta, beta and gamma bands. Inattentive symptoms were predicted by eyes-open EEG connectivity in delta, alpha and gamma bands, and eyes-closed EEG connectivity in delta and gamma bands. EEG connectivity features did not reliably classify participants into groups. CONCLUSIONS: EEG connectivity may represent a neuromarker for ADHD symptoms.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential component representing pre-attentive auditory processing, which is closely associated with cognitive status. We investigated MMN features as biomarkers to classify drug-naive adult patients with ADHD and healthy controls (HCs). Sensor-level features (amplitude and latency) and source-level features (source activation) of MMN were investigated and compared between the electroencephalograms of 34 patients with ADHD and 45 HCs using a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Correlations between MMN features and ADHD symptoms were analyzed. Finally, we applied machine learning to differentiate the two groups using sensor- and source-level features of MMN. Adult patients with ADHD showed significantly lower MMN amplitudes at the frontocentral electrodes and reduced MMN source activation in the frontal, temporal, and limbic lobes, which were closely associated with MMN generators and ADHD pathophysiology. Source activities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The best classification performance for adult ADHD patients and HCs showed an 81.01% accuracy, 82.35% sensitivity, and 80.00% specificity based on MMN source activity features.

Moreover, identifying ADHD in AUD patients is time-consuming and difficult. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of two self-report screening instruments for adult ADHD in AUD patients. METHODS: 404 adults seeking residential treatment for AUD were screened using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Screening Self-Rating (CAARS-S-SR) and the Adult ADHD Rating Scale (ASRS). Results were compared with ADHD diagnosis obtained from a stepped approach: first, a structured interview (Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults 2.0.; DIVA) was applied; second, probable ADHD diagnoses had to be confirmed by two expert clinicians. RESULTS: At the previously reported cut-off values, ASRS and CAARS-S-SR showed low sensitivities of 57.1 and 70.6%. A high number of false negative results (NPV ASRS: 89.5%; CAARS-S-SR: 92.3%) indicates underreporting of ADHD symptoms. Sensitivity improved at lower cut-off (ASRSââ¥â11; CAARS-S-SR â¥60) or with a combination of both instruments at lower cut-offs. Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the combination of ASRS and CAARS-S-SR was superior to the AUCs of the single questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Underreporting of ADHD symptoms in ASRS and CAARS-S-SR of AUD patients requires lower cut-off values to detect the majority of ADHD, albeit at the expense of an increased rate of false-positive results. Cut-off values should be adjusted to the clinical setting.

The study aimed to validate self-report instruments for assessment of adult ADHD in a sample of treatment-seeking adults attending community drug and alcohol teams. METHODS: : Adult patients attending 3 National Health Service (NHS) community drug and alcohol teams in England completed several self-report instruments for assessment of adult ADHD symptoms, and a diagnosis of adult ADHD was determined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria with an interview with both the patient and an informant. RESULTS: : One hundred seven subjects completed the project. Thirty-nine percent of subjects had an undisputed diagnosis of adult ADHD. The most accurate self-report instrument for diagnosis of adult ADHD was the Connors Adult ADHD Rating Scale Self-report Long version-a cutoff of 91 of 198 gave a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 83%.

METHODS: A normative sample was recruited, and additional participants came from trials involving ADHD, anxiety, or depression. Using the investigator-administered WRAADDS, participants in the ADHD sample were classified as ADHD inattentive presentation or ADHD emotional dysregulation presentation. RESULTS: In the ADHD sample, the SR-WRAADDS correlated with the investigator-rated version WRAADDS (P < .001). In comparing adults with ADHD with normal controls, all SR-WRAADDS domains demonstrated discriminate validity (P < .001); a cut point was identified yielding sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 89%. In comparison, in screening for ADHD in depression or anxiety disorders, sensitivity was 87% and specificity, 49%.

The aim of the present study was to calculate ADHD prevalence in a large non-clinical sample of medical students using a stepwise design and to determine whether ADHD diagnosis varies if interviewees use additional probing procedures to obtain examples of positive DSM items. METHODS: A total of 726 students were screened with the Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and invited for an interview with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) adapted for adults. RESULTS: The ASRS was positive for 247 students (37%), although only 83 (7.9%) received an ADHD diagnosis. ASRS sensitivity and specificity rates were 0.97 and 0.40, respectively. Probing procedures were used with a subgroup of 226 students, which decreased the number of ADHD diagnoses to 12 (4.5%). CONCLUSION: Probing for an individual's real-life examples during the K-SADS interview almost halved ADHD prevalence rate based on the ASRS and K-SADS, which rendered the rate consistent with that typically reported for young adults. In reclassified cases, although examples of inattention did not match the corresponding DSM item, they often referred to another DSM inattention item.",,29451590,,"Instituto D'Or de Pesquisae Ensino (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

K., Franke, B., Hoogman, M.","Cognitive heterogeneity in adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic analysis of neuropsychological measurements","Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in childhood is associated with impaired functioning in multiple cognitive domains: executive functioning (EF), reward and timing. Similar impairments have been described for adults with persistent ADHD, but an extensive investigation of neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of adult patients is currently lacking. We systematically examined neuropsychological performance on tasks measuring EF, delay discounting, time estimation and response variability using univariate ANCOVA's comparing patients with persistent ADHD (N=133, 42% male, mean age 36) and healthy adults (N=132, 40% male, mean age 36). In addition, we tested which combination of variables provided the highest accuracy in predicting ADHD diagnosis. We also estimated for each individual the severity of neuropsychological dysfunctioning. Lastly, we investigated potential effects of stimulant medication and a history of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) on performance. Compared to healthy adults, patients with ADHD showed impaired EF, were more impulsive, and more variable in responding. However, effect sizes were small to moderate (range: 0.05-0.70) and 11% of patients did not show neuropsychological dysfunctioning. The best fitting model predicting ADHD included measures from distinct cognitive domains (82.1% specificity, 64.9% sensitivity). Furthermore, patients receiving stimulant medication or with a history of MDD were not distinctively impaired. To conclude, while adults with ADHD as a group are impaired on several cognitive domains, the results confirm that adult ADHD is neuropsychologically heterogeneous.

M.","Discriminating between ADHD adults and controls using independent ERP components and a support vector machine: a validation study","BACKGROUND: There are numerous event-related potential (ERP) studies in relation to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a substantial number of ERP correlates of the disorder have been identified. However, most of the studies are limited to group differences in children. Independent component analysis (ICA) separates a set of mixed event-related potentials into a corresponding set of statistically independent source signals, which are likely to represent different functional processes. Using a support vector machine (SVM), a classification method originating from machine learning, this study aimed at investigating the use of such independent ERP components in differentiating adult ADHD patients from non-clinical controls by selecting a most informative feature set. A second aim was to validate the predictive power of the SVM classifier by means of an independent ADHD sample recruited at a different laboratory. METHODS: Two groups of age-matched adults (75 ADHD, 75 controls) performed a visual two stimulus go/no-go task. ERP responses were decomposed into independent components, and a selected set of independent ERP component features was used for SVM classification. RESULTS: Using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, classification accuracy was 91%. Predictive power of the SVM classifier was verified on the basis of the independent ADHD sample (17 ADHD patients), resulting in a classification accuracy of 94%. The latency and amplitude measures which in combination differentiated best between ADHD patients and non-clinical subjects primarily originated from independent components associated with inhibitory and other executive operations.

METHODS: Thirty adults with ADHD, aged 18-43, were evaluated with the AQT color (C), form (F) and color-form combination (CF) naming tests before and after medication with methylphenidate. Thirty age- and sex-matched normal adults served as controls. RESULTS: Among adults with ADHD, pre-medication naming times (s) for C, F, and CF were significantly longer and overhead [CF - (C + F)] significantly larger than post-medication. Before medication, C, F and CF naming and processing efficiency (overhead) (s) differed significantly between ADHD adults and controls. After medication, there were no significant differences between groups. When we used fail criteria for dual-dimension naming (> 60 s) and overhead (processing efficiency) (> + 6 s) together the sensitivity was 93% and specificity 100%.

J., Charman, T., Pickles, A., Baird, G., Simonoff, E.","Screening for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Young Autistic Adults: The Diagnostic Accuracy of Three Commonly Used Questionnaires","OBJECTIVE: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common co-occurring condition in autistic individuals. ADHD is sometimes first recognised in young adulthood because ADHD symptoms may be misattributed to autism due to superficial overlap in presentation and diagnostic overshadowing. It should be investigated whether ADHD questionnaires are accurate in screening symptoms in young adults with autism. The current study examined this. METHODS: Participants were autistic young adults (Nâ=â119) who took part in the Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP), a population-based cohort. ADHD research diagnoses were obtained through the parent-informed Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment. Parents and young adults (self-report sample Nâ=â71) completed ADHD questionnaires (Aberrant Behavior Checklist hyperactivity/non-compliance subscale, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales ADHD Index, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ADHD subscale). Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to explore if the questionnaires discriminated ADHD cases from non-cases. To assess whether results varied by intellectual functioning, subgroup analyses were completed for those with an IQââ¥â70 vs. <70. RESULTS: Weighted ADHD rates were high. Overall although the measures were performing at or close to adequate levels (area under the curve was 0.66 to 0.79 for parent-report and 0.70 to 0.65 for self-report), no single measure met adequate thresholds for sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. Tool performance was not different for those with an IQââ¥â70 vs. <70. CONCLUSION: No single measure reported adequate performance for distinguishing ADHD from non-ADHD cases in this sample of young autistic adults.

The Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA 2.0) and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) v.1.1 together with eight neuropsychological tests were investigated. RESULTS: All instruments showed poor discriminative ability except for the DIVA, which showed a relatively good ability to discriminate between the groups (sensitivity = 90.0; specificity = 72.9). A logistic regression analysis model with the DIVA and measures of inattention, impulsivity, and activity from continuous performance tests (CPTs) showed a sensitivity of 90.0 and a specificity of 83.3.

The resting electroencephalogram (EEG) provides non-invasive spectral markers of brain function and development. Their accuracy as ADHD markers is increasingly questioned but may improve with pattern classification. METHODS: This study provides an integrated analysis of ADHD and developmental effects in children and adults using regression analysis and support vector machine classification of spectral resting (eyes-closed) EEG biomarkers in order to clarify their diagnostic value. RESULTS: ADHD effects on EEG strongly depend on age and frequency. We observed typical non-linear developmental decreases in delta and theta power for both ADHD and control groups. However, for ADHD adults we found a slowing in alpha frequency combined with a higher power in alpha-1 (8-10Hz) and beta (13-30Hz). Support vector machine classification of ADHD adults versus controls yielded a notable cross validated sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 83% using power and central frequency from all frequency bands. ADHD children were not classified convincingly with these markers. CONCLUSIONS: Resting state electrophysiology is altered in ADHD, and these electrophysiological impairments persist into adulthood.

METHODS: Power spectra of resting EEG, CSD and gIC (19 channels, linked ears reference, eyes open/closed) from 96 ADHD and 376 healthy adults were compared between eyes open and eyes closed conditions, and between groups of subjects. RESULTS: Pattern of differences in gIC and CSD spectral power between conditions was approximately similar, whereas it was more widely spatially distributed for EEG. Size effect (Cohen's d) of differences in gIC and CSD spectral power between groups of subjects was considerably greater than in the case of EEG. Significant reduction of gIC and CSD spectral power depending on conditions was found in ADHD patients. Reducing power in a wide frequency range in the fronto-central areas is a common phenomenon regardless of whether the eyes were open or closed.

Instead of actual factors scores, we employed ""item averages"" calculated by the average score of each item comprising that factor. We did not present a factor analysis of the WURS-25. Herein we identify items of the full WURS that are redundant or not part of any of the scale's five factors. Removing these items produced a shortened version, the WURS-45. We performed a logistic regression using actual factor loadings as well as factors based on item averages, and compared major depressive disorder (MDD) to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients in the same analysis. We performed exploratory factor analysis with the WURS-45 items. We then performed logistic regressions and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses with the WURS-45 and WURS-25 factors. No increase in specificity or sensitivity arose when actual factors scores were used as opposed to factor scores from item averages. MDD and GAD ROC curves were very similar, supporting combining MDD with GAD patients into a single group. WURS-45 factors paralleled those derived from the full WURS. ROC curves, logistic regression and confusion tables showed the WURS-45 preserved the excellent diagnostic separation produced by the full WURS. Similar analyses showed WURS-25 scoring using its three factors improved its diagnostic utility. The WURS-45 has reduced redundancy with minimal loss in discriminatory power. Analysis of the WURS-25 using factor scores boosts its performance. Both versions of the scale provide clinical information describing childhood ADHD and are useful in separating adult patients with ADHD from those with MDD or GAD.",,34235235,,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.

METHODS: Spatio-temporal interrelations and synchronicity of multi-sited ERP activity peaks were extracted in a group of 13 ADHD patients and 13 control subjects for the No-go stimulus in a Go/No-go task. Participants were scored by cross-validation against the most discriminative ensuing group patterns and scores were correlated to neuropsychological evaluation scores. RESULTS: A distinct frontal-central-parietal pattern in the delta frequency range, dominant at the P3 latency, was unraveled in controls, while central activity in the theta and alpha frequency ranges predominated in the ADHD pattern, involving early ERP components (P1-N1-P2-N2). Cross-validation based on this analysis yielded 92% specificity and 84% sensitivity and individual scores correlated well with behavioral assessments.

F.","Intentional inattention: Detecting feigned attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on the Personality Assessment Inventory","Given the increasing number of college students seeking Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnoses as well as the potential secondary gains associated with this disorder (e.g., access to stimulant medication, academic accommodations), the detection of malingered symptom presentations in this population is a major concern. The present study examined the ability of validity indicators on the widely used Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) to distinguish between individuals experiencing genuine ADHD symptoms and individuals instructed to present with ADHD symptomatology for secondary gain. Sixty-six participants who successfully simulated ADHD (based on elevations on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale; Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, 1998) were compared with a sample of undergraduate students meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD (N = 22) and an archival sample of adults who received an ADHD diagnosis at a university psychology clinic following a comprehensive psychological evaluation (N = 41). Successful simulators obtained significantly higher scores on all relevant PAI validity indicators compared with the clinical and archival comparison samples, with the Rogers Discriminant Function demonstrating the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = .86). Traditional cut scores on the Negative Impression (NIM) validity scale used to designate probable malingering, however, were not sensitive to simulated ADHD symptoms, although they did demonstrate excellent specificity. The PAI may be informative as an indicator of potentially exaggerated or malingered symptom presentation, but alternative cut scores for symptom validity indicators may be necessary to maximize its utility in these particular types of psychological evaluations.

","SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m, S., Pettersson, R., Nilsson, K. W.","Quantitative and subjective behavioural aspects in the assessment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults","BACKGROUND: Self-rating scales and cognitive tests are instruments used in the assessment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, few studies have examined the differential validity of these kinds of instruments in psychiatric samples. AIMS: To examine the discriminative validity of two self-report scales (ADHD Self-Report Scale [ASRS v.1.1], Current Symptom Scale [CSS]) and a continuous performance test with measures of motor activity (QBTest Plus). METHODS: The interrelation between the instruments, and their abilities to differentiate between patients with an ADHD diagnosis and non-ADHD patients referred for psychiatric assessment were examined in a naturalistic sample of 61 adult patients. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the dichotomized versions of the test variables in all tests ranged from 0.61 to 0.71. The ASRS and CSS exhibited sensitivity of 90.2% and 85.4%, and specificity of 35.0% and 40.0%, respectively. Variables from the QBTest Plus showed the opposite result for the variables QBImpulsivity and QBInattention, with sensitivity of 58.5% and 36.3% and specificity of 80.0% and 100.0%. Sensitivity and specificity of QBActivity were 68.3% and 65.0%, respectively. A stepwise discriminant function analysis showed that two variables from the QBTest Plus--QBInattention and QBActivity--accounted for 22.8% of the between-group variability, with the strongest predictor being QBInattention. The function yielded an overall correct classification of 72.1%. The classification correctly identified 87.8% of patients diagnosed with ADHD and 40.0% of non-ADHD patients.

","Solanto, M. V., Etefia, K., Marks, D. J.","The utility of self-report measures and the continuous performance test in the diagnosis of ADHD in adults","BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in as many as 4 percent of adults yet it is often not recognized in clinical settings because the presenting symptoms may resemble those seen in other disorders or because symptoms may be masked by commonly comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic utility of instruments commonly used in the assessment of adults presenting with symptoms of ADHD. METHODS: We reviewed several widely used self-report and laboratory measures and empirically examined the utility of the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults (Brown ADD Scale) and the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in differentially identifying adults with ADHD and those with other Axis I disorders. RESULTS: Ninety-three adults who self-referred to the ADHD program for adults at a university medical center participated in the study. Of these, 44 had ADHD combined subtype (ADHD-CB), and 26 had ADHD, predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-IA). Thirty-three non-ADHD adults diagnosed with Axis I mood or anxiety disorders comprised an ""Other Psychiatric"" group. Rates of comorbid disorders, including substance abuse, in the ADHD groups were typical of those reported in the adult ADHD literature. Data on the Brown ADD Scale and on the CPT were available for subsets of 61 and 46 participants, respectively. Analyses showed that the ADHD-CB, ADHD-IA, and Other Psychiatric groups all received mean scores in the clinical range on the Brown ADD Scale, with a trend toward even higher elevations in the two ADHD groups. Among 12 CPT variables assessed for the three groups, the mean scores on only two variables for the ADHD-IA group were clinically elevated. Neither the Brown ADD Scale nor CPT scores evinced sufficient sensitivity and specificity to qualify them to assist in differential diagnosis of ADHD vis-a-vis other, predominantly internalizing, psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a need for closer examination of executive and adaptive functioning in adults with ADHD compared with those with internalizing disorders in order to identify features that could assist in differential diagnosis.",,15337862,,"Department of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.",,,,,NLM,Sep,"2024-08-02 17:28:36","2024-08-02 17:28:36",10.1017/s1092852900001929,2004/09/01,,"1092-8529 (Print) 1092-8529",9,"CNS Spectr","Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis Diagnosis, Differential Humans *Self-Assessment *Surveys and Questionnaires",eng,"Pubmed May 28 2024",,"Solanto, Mary V Etefia, Kennett Marks, David J Journal Article United States CNS Spectr. 2004 Sep;9(9):649-59. doi: 10.1017/s1092852900001929.",,,649-59,,,,,"The utility of self-report measures and the continuous performance test in the diagnosis of ADHD in adults",,,JOUR,,,9,2004,EPCReviewer7,3,"check for combination data",,KQ1,"The study examined the utility of self-report measures (Brown ADD Scale) and neuropsychological tools (Conners Continuous Performance Test) for diagnosing ADHD in adults",KQ1a,"The study found differences in test scores between ADHD subtypes (ADHD-CB vs. ADHD-IA)",,,,,"Solanto, 2004{#870}","ID N/A",,US,,"Single center","The study was conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, United States",Unclear,,"Specialty care","Neuropsychological clinic within the Mount Sinai School of Medicine",,"ADHD combined (44); ADHD Inattentive (26);  Other psychiatric (33)","Adults aged 18-45 diagnosed with ADHD by clinical evaluation based on DSM-IV criteria, excluding individuals with neurological disorders, intellectual disabilities, or severe substance use disorders, and requiring stable medication use or no psychotropic medications during the assessment timeframe","The non-ADHD participants included adults aged 18-45 recruited from the same specialty care setting, with diagnoses of other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, or adjustment disorders, but who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD",,,,,,,,,,,other,"ADHD combined; ADHD Inattentive; other psychiatric",,,"male: ADHD combined (24); ADHD Inattentive (18); Other Psychiatric (16)",,"ADHD combined 34.34 (8.78); ADHD Inattentive 36.08(11.60); Other psychiatric 44.39(10.35)",25,60,Mixed,25-60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,Other,"ADHD combined (2.2); ADHD Inattentive (0); other psychiatric (0)",,,Other,"ADHD combined (2.2); ADHD Inattentive (0); other psychiatric (4.3)",,,,,,,Other,"ADHD combined (11.1); ADHD Inattentive (3.8); other psychiatric (4.3)",,,,,,,Other,"ADHD combined (84.1); ADHD Inattentive (96.2); other psychiatric (91.3)",,,,,inattentive,25.24,,,,,,,combined,47.42,,,,,"Self report",,,Neuropsychological,,,,,,,,No,No,"Clinical diagnosis","Diagnosed with ADHD based on DSM-IV criteria through a comprehensive clinical interview conducted by experienced psychologists, supplemented with developmental history, school records, standardized test reports","Specialist (e.g., mental health)",,Concurrent,"Brown ADD Scale (Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale) assesses executiveand adaptive functioning across five clusters (Activation, Attention, Effort, Affect, and Memory), with a T-score cutoff of 50 indicating clinical significance.

","Sollman, M. J., Ranseen, J. D., Berry, D. T.","Detection of feigned ADHD in college students","Significant motivations and incentives exist for young-adult students to seek a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). With ADHD information readily accessible on the Internet, today's students are likely to be symptom educated prior to evaluation. This may result in false-positive diagnoses, particularly when students are motivated to convey symptoms. We evaluated the utility of ADHD symptom checklists, neurocognitive tests, and measures initially developed to detect feigned neurocognitive or psychiatric dysfunction (symptom validity tests [SVTs]). The performance of 31 undergraduates financially motivated and coached about ADHD via Internet-derived information was compared to that of 29 ADHD undergraduates following medication washout and 14 students not endorsing symptomatology. Results indicated malingerers readily produced ADHD-consistent profiles. Symptom checklists, including the ADHD Rating Scale and Conners's Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self-Rating Form: Long, were particularly susceptible to faking. Conners's Continuous Performance Test-II findings appeared more related to motivation than condition. Promising results were seen with all cognitive SVTs (Test of Memory Malingering [TOMM], Digit Memory Test, Letter Memory Test, and Nonverbal-Medical Symptom Validity Test), particularly TOMM Trial 1 when scored using Trial 2 criteria. All SVTs demonstrated very high specificity for the ADHD condition and moderate sensitivity to faking, which translated into high positive predictive values at rising base rates of feigning.

Standalone performance validity tests (PVTs) have shown some success in identifying feigned ADHD, but these tests are rarely used in typical ADHD evaluation batteries. The present study attempted to develop embedded PVT indices from the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ-IV). College students (Nâ=â150) completed a battery including tasks from the WJ-IV, as well as an established standalone PVT and a rating scale measuring ADHD and related symptoms. Thirty of the students had been professionally diagnosed with ADHD; of the remaining 120 students, half were asked to perform honestly and to the best of their ability on the battery, whereas the other half were asked to try to simulate ADHD. Several processing speed and working memory scores from the WJ-IV effectively identified students feigning ADHD, detecting at least 50% of those students at score cutoffs that also maintained specificity of 90% or more, close to the efficiency of the standalone PVT.

This can result in psychosocial and functional decline. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical use of three objective computerised tests in the diagnosis of adult patients with ADHD. METHODS: Case-control study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: aged 18-65, ADHD diagnosis; exclusion criteria: visual impairments, colour vision deficiencies, acute mental illness, amnesia, and learning difficulties. ADHD was diagnosed with Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (n=14) and were matched for gender and age against normal controls (n=30). Three computer-based tasks, Stroop test, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity test were completed. Accuracy (%) and response time (ms) were measured. Generalized Estimating Equations method was used to analyse those repeated measurements data. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each test. RESULTS: Mean age of cases was 47.29 (SD 9.03), 9 males. Mean age of controls was 41.57 (SD 11.42), 13 males. Individuals with ADHD had significantly worse performances in both accuracy and response time in all the tests. The best discriminate ability was the Stroop test (accuracy and response time), followed by the Perceptual Selectivity test (response time). Comparisons of AUCs of the tests did not show any significant differences. Age had a significant effect on the Stroop and Stroop Plus tests but not in the Perceptual Selectivity test.

The second screen consisted of the stimulus: one colour word at a pixel resolution of 85 was shown at the centre of the screen. Any of the four color words were shown randomly (red, green, blue, yellow). The font colour of the words were either congruent to the word itself or incongruent. The ratio of congruent to incongruent tasks was 1:3. Participants were asked to respond to the color of the word and not the word itself as fast as they could (for example, the word âblueâ written in red letters). This task demanded the selection of relevant information (e.g. attention to the color of the ink) and ignoring the verbal content.
Stroop Plus Test: This test was designed similar to the Stroop test, however, it also included an inhibitory stimulus in the form of an arrow pointing to a colored box. The word stimulus was positioned at the centre of the screen with 4 colored boxes (red, green, blue, yellow) measuring 3 cm x 3 cm positioned at perpendicular angles 5cm from the word stimulus. An arrow measuring 3 cm pointed randomly at any of the colored boxes during each run and acted as an inhibitory stimulus. The congruent to incongruent ratio of the word stimulus was again 1:3 but when considering the congruency of all the stimuli (word, arrow and coloured box) it was 1:9. Participants were asked to respond to the font colour of the word and not the verbal content of the word as fast as they could by pressing the relevant key. While the Stroop test was used to measure selective attention, the arrow was used to measure intentional motor inhibition, also known as executive inhibition.
Perceptual Selectivity Test: The Stroop test was presented at the centre of the screen. Four shapes with a radius of 1.5 cm were shown 5 cm from the word stimulus and were positioned perpendicularly to it. Three of the shapes were similar and one was different from the rest. The shapes could be either circles or squares. The colour font of the shapes were either all blue or all yellow in 50% of runs. In the other 50%, 3 were yellow and 1 blue and vice versa. In each of the shapes a line of 2.5 cm length was presented and was positioned at either -45 degrees , 0 degrees , 45 degrees or 90 degrees. In this test the participants were asked to respond to the orientation of the line in the odd shape by pressing the corresponding key and the hence colours were irrelevant. The orientation could be either horizontal or vertical. This test was used to measure a subtype of selective attention known as perceptual selectivity. This term refers to how discriminable a stimulus is: in other words, how effectively the participant can distinguish the goal task when presented with a single stimulus (change in shape only) and when faced with two stimuli (change in shape and the presence of an irrelevant colour).",,,,,,,"Sensitivity is not available",,,"Specificity is not available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stroop Test (accuracy): 0.814 (p=.001; 95% CI: .679, .949); Stroop Test (response time): .810 (p=.001; 95% CI: .664, .955); Stroop Plus Test (accuracy): .723 (p=.018; 95% CI: .569, .876); Stroop Plus Test (response time): .724 (p=.018; 95% CI: .563, .885); Perceptual Selectivity Test (accuracy): .707 (p=.028, 95% CI: .542, .872); Perceptual Selectivity Test (response time): .783 (p=.003; 95% CI: .643, .924)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The study evaluated the clinical utility of three computerized neuropsychological testsâStroop, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivityâto distinguish adults with ADHD from controls.

C.","The World Health Organization Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Screening Scale for DSM-5","IMPORTANCE: Recognition that adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common, seriously impairing, and usually undiagnosed has led to the development of adult ADHD screening scales for use in community, workplace, and primary care settings. However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria. OBJECTIVES: To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general population surveys (2001-2003 household survey [nâ=â119] and 2004-2005 managed care subscriber survey [nâ=â218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011-2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015-2016 primary care controls (nâ=â300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS. RESULTS: Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples. Operating characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold in the weighted (to the 8.2% DSM-5/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population prevalence) data (sensitivity, 91.4%; specificity, 96.0%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3%). Operating characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7%) when the scale was applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9%; specificity, 74.0%; AUC, 0.83; PPV, 82.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, detects the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also has high specificity and PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty treatment settings.",,28384801,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

OBJECTIVES: To test the performance of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale V 1.1(ASRS) for adult ADHD in an international sample of treatment seeking SUD patients for DSM-IV-TR; for the proposed DSM-5 criteria; in different subpopulations, at intake and 1-2 weeks after intake; using different scoring algorithms; and different externalizing disorders as external criterion (including adult ADHD, bipolar disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder). METHODS: In 1138 treatment seeking SUD subjects, ASRS performance was determined using diagnoses based on Conner's Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID) as gold standard. RESULTS: The prevalence of adult ADHD was 13.0% (95% CI: 11.0-15.0%). The overall positive predictive value (PPV) of the ASRS was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.22-0.30), the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98). The sensitivity (0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.88) and specificity (0.66, 95% CI: 0.63-0.69) measured at admission were similar to the sensitivity (0.88, 95% CI: 0.83-0.93) and specificity (0.67, 95% CI: 0.64-0.70) measured 2 weeks after admission. Sensitivity was similar, but specificity was significantly better in patients with alcohol compared to (illicit) drugs as the primary substance of abuse (0.76 vs. 0.56). ASRS was not a good screener for externalizing disorders other than ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The ASRS is a sensitive screener for identifying possible ADHD cases with very few missed cases among those screening negative in this population.",,23660242,,"Trimbos-instituut and ICASA Foundation, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Amsterdam Institute for Addiction Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This study examined these variables using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS). METHOD: The sample included 349 adults evaluated for attention problems. Correlations and kappa values were calculated using self- and observer-ratings of item-level symptoms; sensitivity, specificity, and discriminant validity of cluster scores in predicting clinician diagnoses were computed for 269 participants. RESULTS: Item-level concordance rates ranged from slight to fair. Cluster scores demonstrated a poor balance of sensitivity and specificity in predicting ADHD diagnosis; a high percentage of participants with internalizing disorders had scores in the clinical range.

H.","Exploring DSM-5 ADHD criteria beyond young adulthood: phenomenology, psychometric properties and prevalence in a large three-decade birth cohort","BACKGROUND: There are still uncertainties on the psychometric validity of the DSM-5 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) criteria for its use in the adult population. We aim to describe the adult ADHD phenotype, to test the psychometric properties of the DSM-5 ADHD criteria, and to calculate the resulting prevalence in a population-based sample in their thirties. METHOD: A cross-sectional evaluation using the DSM-5 ADHD criteria was carried out in 3574 individuals from the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort. Through receiver operator curve, latent and regression analyses, we obtained parameters on construct and discriminant validity. Still, prevalence rates were calculated for different sets of criteria. RESULTS: The latent analysis suggested that the adult ADHD phenotype is constituted mainly by inattentive symptoms. Also, inattention symptoms were the symptoms most associated with impairment. The best cut-off for diagnosis was four symptoms, but sensitivity and specificity for this cut-off was low. ADHD prevalence rates were 2.1% for DSM-5 ADHD criteria and 5.8% for ADHD disregarding age-of-onset criterion. CONCLUSIONS: The bi-dimensional ADHD structure proposed by the DSM demonstrated both construct and discriminant validity problems when used in the adult population, since inattention is a much more relevant feature in the adult phenotype. The use of the DSM-5 criteria results in a higher prevalence of ADHD when compared to those obtained by DSM-IV, and prevalence would increase almost threefold when considering current ADHD syndrome. These findings suggest a need for further refinement of the criteria for its use in the adult population.",,27866484,,"Department of Psychiatry,ADHD Out-patient Program, Hospital de ClÃ­nicas de Porto Alegre, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul,Porto Alegre,Brazil.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dataset of resting state fMRI contains 23 patients with ADHD and 23 healthy subjects were analyzed. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was extracted from resting state fMRI signals and used as model inputs. Raw ReHo features were ranked and selected in a loop according to their p values. Selected features were trained and tested by support vector machines (SVM) in a cross validation procedure. Cross validation was repeated in feature selection loop to produce optimized model. RESULTS: Optimized discriminative map indicated that the ADHD brains exhibit more increased activities than normal controls in bilateral occipital lobes and left front lobe. The altered brain regions included portions of basal ganglia, insula, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), thalamus, and cerebellum. Correlation coefficients indicated significant positive correlation of inattentive scores with bilateral cuneus and precuneus, and significant negative correlation of hyperactive/impulsive scores with bilateral insula and claustrum. Additionally, the optimized model produced total accuracy of 80% and sensitivity of 87%. CONCLUSION: ADHD brain regions were more activated than normal controls during resting state.

","Wiig, E. H., Nielsen, N. P.","A quick test of cognitive speed for comparing processing speed to differentiate adult psychiatric referrals with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders","OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study used A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) to compare processing speed and efficiency measures by adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or non-ADHD psychiatric disorders and healthy controls. METHOD: Color, form, and color-form combination naming tests were administered to 104 adults, ages 17-55 years, referred for psychiatric evaluation of possible ADHD. Thirty healthy adults were controls. Psychiatric intake procedures identified 64 adults with ADHD (ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria) and 40 with mild psychiatric disorders without ADHD. The study was conducted from 2008 through 2010. RESULTS: At intake, color, form, and color-form combination naming times (seconds) were longer and overhead [color-form combination - (color + form)] was larger for patients with ADHD than for non-ADHD patients and controls. In the ADHD group, color and form measures were in the normal range. Color-form combination was in the slower-than-normal speed (60-70 seconds) and overhead, a processing-efficiency measure, in the atypical range (> 10 seconds). In the non-ADHD patient and control groups, all AQT measures were in the normal range. Analysis of variance with post hoc analysis of log-normal values for color, form, and color-form combination and time for overhead indicated significant (Bonferroni P < .01) mean differences between the ADHD and other groups, but not between the non-ADHD and control groups.

The current diagnosis of ADHD primarily depends on the judgment of clinical symptoms, which highlights the need for objective imaging biomarkers. In this study, we aim to classify ADHD (both children and adults [34/112]) from age-matched healthy controls (HCs [28/77]) with functional connectivity (FCs) pattern derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. However, the neuroimaging classification of brain disorders often meets a situation of high dimensional features were presented with limited sample size. Thus an efficient method that is able to reduce original feature dimension into a much more refined subspace is highly desired. Here we proposed a novel Feature Selection method based on Relative Importance and Ensemble Learning (FS_RIEL). Compared with traditional feature selection methods, FS_RIEL algorithm improved the ADHD classification by about 15% in both child and adult ADHD classification, achieving 80-86% accuracy. Moreover, we found the most frequently selected FCs were mainly involved in frontoparietal network, default network, salience network, basal ganglia network and cerebellum network in both child and adult ADHD cohorts, which indicates that ADHD is characterized by a widely-impaired brain connectivity profile that may serve as potential biomarkers for its early diagnosis.",,30441383,,,,,,,NLM,Jul,"2024-08-02 17:28:39","2024-08-02 17:28:39",10.1109/embc.2018.8513155,2018/11/18,,2375-7477,,"Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc","Adult Algorithms Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis Brain/*diagnostic imaging *Brain Mapping Case-Control Studies Child *Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted Female Humans Machine Learning Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Young Adult",eng,"Pubmed May 28 2024",,"2694-0604 Yao, Dongren Guo, Xiaojie Zhao, Qihua Liu, Lu Cao, Qingjiu Wang, Yufeng D Calhoun, Vince Sun, Li Sui, Jing P20 GM103472/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01 EB006841/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States R01 EB005846/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2018 Jul;2018:4632-4635. doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513155.",,,4632-4635,,,,,"Discriminating ADHD From Healthy Controls Using a Novel Feature Selection Method Based on Relative Importance and Ensemble Learning",,,JOUR,,,2018,2018,EPCReviewer7,3,,,,,,,,,Unclear,"The study does not evaluate or compare diagnostic tools commonly used in primary care or specialty care for ADHD, nor does it report adverse events; and no discussion of how diagnostic accuracy varies by clinical setting, patient characteristics, or risk factors.","Yao, 2018{#1011}","ID N/A",,China,,Multicenter,"Peking University Sixth Hospital (PKU6) and Beijing Normal University (BNU)","Public funding","National Natural Science Foundation; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; 100 Talents Planâ of Chinese Academy of Sciences; NIH",School/University,"Peking University Sixth Hospital; Beijing Normal University",251,,"Participants with ADHD were recruited from clinics at Peking University Sixth Hospital, quired to be drug-naÃ¯ve for stimulants and psychotropic drugs, have an IQ score greater than 80, and be right-handed","Non-ADHD participants were age-matched healthy controls recruited from local universities, with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders, and were selected to match the ADHD participants in demographics and handedness",Neurotypical,"The non-ADHD participants in this study were described as healthy controls, with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders",,,,,,,,,,,,25.3,,"25.93 (4.86)",,,34,Mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,Neuroimaging,,,,,,,Yes,Partially,"Clinical diagnosis","Diagnosed with ADHD based on clinical evaluation conducted by mental health clinicians at Peking University Sixth Hospital following established diagnostic criteria.","Specialist (e.g., mental health)","Mental health clinician",Concurrent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Resting state-fMRI (functional MRI) to analyze functional connectivity patterns across 246 brain regions, identifying potential biomarkers for ADHD diagnosis; a novel feature selection method, FS_RIEL, was applied to reduce dimensionality and improve classification accuracy",133,50,27,13,91,,,65,,,83,,79,,2.6,,0.14,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The method achieved 80% accuracy in distinguishing ADHD from healthy controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,,"Low risk","The study ensured age- and sex-matched healthy controls for comparison with ADHD patients.

H.","Diagnostic accuracy of a brief screening tool for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in UK prison inmates","BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is overrepresented in prison, making it imperative to identify a screening tool that can be quickly applied to efficiently detect the disorder. We explored the discrimination ability of a widely used ADHD screen, the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale (BAARS-IV), against a clinical diagnostic interview. A brief version of the screen was then developed in order to simplify its use in the prison context, and maximize its diagnostic properties. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of 390 male prison inmates was performed in the UK, all participants were screened and interviewed via the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults 2.0 (DIVA-2). RESULTS: A total of 47 (12.1%) inmates screened positive for ADHD using the full BAARS-IV, and 96 (24.6%) were clinically diagnosed, for a sensitivity of 37.9 and a specificity of 96.3. Our models identified the six items that most predicted ADHD diagnosis, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.66 to 4.58. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.82, 0.84 and 0.84, respectively, for the developed brief scale, and 0.71, 0.85 and 0.81 for its validation. Weighted probability scores produced an area under the curve of 0.89 for development, and 0.82 for validation of the brief scale. CONCLUSIONS: The original BAARS-IV performed poorly at identifying prison inmates with ADHD. Our developed brief scale substantially improved diagnostic accuracy. The brief screening instrument has great potential to be used as an accurate and resource-effective tool to screen young people and adults for likely ADHD in the criminal justice system.",,26867860,,"Division of Brain Sciences,Department of Medicine,Centre for Mental Health,Imperial College,London,UK.

H.","Neuropsychological correlates of the YAQ-S and YAQ-I self- and informant-reported ADHD symptomatology, emotional and social problems and delinquent behaviour","OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the relationship between self- and informant-rated symptoms of ADHD and performance on neuropsychological tests of attention and impulsivity (Letter Cancellation Test [LCT], Continuous Performance Test [CPT] and Matching Familiar Figures test [MFF]). DESIGN: Participants were clinical referrals for assessment of ADHD in adulthood and healthy controls. METHOD: ADHD adults were compared with individuals with mild psychiatric disorders (including attention problems), a healthy control group on neuropsychological measures of attention (CPT and LCT) and on impulsivity (MFF). Secondly, the scores obtained on these measures were correlated with the Young ADHD Questionnaire-S (YAQ-S) and Young ADHD Questionnaire-I (YAQ-I) self- and informant-reported scales of ADHD symptomatology, emotional problems, delinquency, and social functioning. RESULTS: The ADHD group were more impaired than the healthy controls on neuropsychological measures, but only the MFF differentiated them from the psychiatric controls. Tests of attentional control positively correlated with the selfreported functioning of the ADHD group but not among the psychiatric or normal controls. There was a positive correlation between tests of attention (but not impulsivity) and self-ratings of ADHD symptomatology for the ADHD group, suggesting that ADHD adults are better at recognizing attentional problems than impulse control. A positive correlation was found between the Delinquency scale and a test of impulsivity for the ADHD group only. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there are neuropsychological underpinnings of the ADHD syndrome but neuropsychological tests may discriminate poorly between ADHD and mild psychiatric disorders.

The current study explored the utility of integrating an eye tracker with a commercially available continuous performance test (CPT), the MOXO-dCPT. As part of the study, the performance of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and healthy controls (n = 43, n = 42, respectively) was compared in the integrated system. More specifically, the MOXO-dCPT has four stages, which differ in their combinations of ecological visual and auditory dynamic distractors. By exploring the participants' performance in each of the stages, we were able to show that: (a) ADHD patients spend significantly more time gazing at irrelevant areas of interest (AOIs) compared to healthy controls; (b) visual distractors are particularly effective in impacting ADHD patients' eye movements, suggesting their enhanced utility in diagnostic procedures; (c) combining gaze direction data and conventional CPT indices enhances group prediction, compared to the sole use of conventional indices. Overall, the findings indicate the utility of eye tracker-integrated CPTs and their enhanced diagnostic precision. They also suggest that the use of attention-grabbing visual distractors may be a promising path for the evolution of existing CPTs by shortening their duration and enhancing diagnostic precision.",,33182303,,"Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Ariel University, Ariel 40700, Israel.

","Harrison, A. G., Armstrong, I. T.","Differences in performance on the test of variables of attention between credible vs. noncredible individuals being screened for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","Measuring performance validity in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) assessments is essential, with multiple studies identifying how easily young adults can feign symptoms on self-report measures. Few methods, however, exist to identify such feigning when it occurs. While some clinicians include computerized tests of attention (e.g., Test of Variables of Attention [TOVA]) when assessing for possible ADHD, it is unclear how symptom exaggerators perform, and whether the TOVA Symptom Exaggeration Index (SEI) adequately identifies performance-based exaggeration when it occurs. Using archival data from a university-based ADHD screening clinic we investigated the performance of 245 late adolescents/emerging adults. Three groups were created: (1) Good effort but not ADHD (nâ=â183); (2) Good effort and diagnosed ADHD (nâ=â13); and (3) suspect effort (nâ=â49), based on final diagnosis and performance on an existing validity measure. Results showed clearly that those with suspect effort performed more poorly than the other two groups on all but second-half commission errors on the TOVA. Similar to Nicholls etÂ al., the suspect effort group showed significantly subaverage (i.e., greater than two standard deviations below the mean) scores in Omission errors; in this replication, however, this was true for both the first and second half of the test. Response time variability was similarly exaggerated, with the suspect effort group again returning extreme scores in both halves of the test.

Novel psychophysiological measures may enhance the data that is derived from CPTs and thereby improve clinical decision-making regarding diagnosis and treatment. As part of the current study, we integrated an eye tracker with the MOXO-dCPT and assessed the utility of eye movement measures to differentiate ADHD patients and healthy controls. METHOD: Adult ADHD patients and gender/age-matched healthy controls performed the MOXO-dCPT while their eye movements were monitored (n = 33âper group). RESULTS: ADHD patients spent significantly more time gazing at irrelevant regions, both on the screen and outside of it, than healthy controls. The eye movement measures showed adequate ability to classify ADHD patients. Moreover, a scale that combined eye movement measures enhanced group prediction, compared to the sole use of conventional MOXO-dCPT indices. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating an eye tracker with CPTs is a feasible way of enhancing diagnostic precision and shows initial promise for clarifying the cognitive profile of ADHD patients.

Method: In a cross-sectional design, differences in self-report questionnaires and neuropsychological tests among clinical subgroups and healthy controls (HC) were evaluated. Patients in clinical groups were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) or ADHD with or without depressive symptoms according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) guidelines. Results: The Hyperactivity subscales of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) differed between MDD and ADHD, whereas self-concept and inattention scales even distinguished comorbidity subgroups within the ADHD population. A reduced alertness and higher variations in reaction times measured by performance tests indicated problems in sustained attention in ADHD patients compared with HC.

In response, several studies have validated tests for use in differentiating feigned from genuine ADHD. Although results have generally been positive, relatively few publications have addressed the possible impact of the presence of psychological disorders comorbid with ADHD. Because ADHD is thought to have accompanying conditions at rates of 50% and higher, it is important to determine if the additional psychological disorders might compromise the accuracy of feigning detection measures. The present study extended the findings of Jasinski et al. (2011) to examine the efficacy of various measures in the context of feigned versus genuine ADHD with comorbid psychological disorders in undergraduate students. Two clinical groups (ADHD only and ADHD + comorbid psychological disorder) were contrasted with two non-clinical groups (normal controls answering honestly and normal participants feigning ADHD). Extending previous research to individuals with ADHD and either an anxiety or learning disorder, performance validity tests such as the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), the Letter Memory Test (LMT), and the Nonverbal Medical Symptom Validity Test (NV-MSVT) were effective in differentiating both ADHD groups from normal participants feigning ADHD.

However, the current diagnostic process exhibits limitations that can significantly affect its overall effectiveness. Notably, its face-to-face and time-consuming nature, coupled with the reliance on subjective recall of historical information and clinician subjectivity, stand out as key challenges. To address these limitations, objective measures such as neuropsychological evaluations, imaging techniques and physiological monitoring of the Autonomic Nervous System functioning, have been explored. Methods: The main aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological data (i.e., Electrodermal Activity, Heart Rate Variability, and Skin Temperature) can serve as meaningful indicators of ADHD, evaluating its utility in distinguishing adult ADHD patients. This observational, case-control study included a total of 76 adult participants (32 ADHD patients and 44 healthy controls) who underwent a series of Stroop tests, while their physiological data was passively collected using a multi-sensor wearable device. Univariate feature analysis was employed to identify the tests that triggered significant signal responses, while the Informative k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used to filter out less informative data points. Finally, a machine-learning decision pipeline incorporating various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), was utilized for ADHD patient detection. Results: Results indicate that the SVM-based model yielded the optimal performance, achieving 81.6% accuracy, maintaining a balance between the experimental and control groups, with sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and 81.9%, respectively. Additionally, integration of data from all physiological signals yielded the best results, suggesting that each modality captures unique aspects of ADHD. Conclusions: This study underscores the potential of physiological signals as valuable diagnostic indicators of adult ADHD. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, our findings demonstrate that multimodal physiological data collected via wearable devices can complement traditional diagnostic approaches. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical applications and long-term implications of utilizing physiological markers in ADHD diagnosis and management.",,,,"D.

","Chen, Tianhua, Antoniou, Grigoris, Adamou, Marios, Tachmazidis, Ilias, Su, Pan","Automatic diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder using machine learning","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes symptoms such as inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is considered as an important public health issue, and prevalence of diagnosis has increased as awareness of the disease grew over the past years. Supply of specialist medical experts has not kept pace with the increasing demand for assessment, both due to financial pressures on health systems and the difficulty to train new experts, resulting in growing waiting lists. Patients are not being treated quickly enough causing problems in other areas of health systems (e.g. increased GP visits, increased risk of self-harm and accidents) and more broadly (e.g. time off work, relationship problems). Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to diagnose ADHD based on the analysis of relevant data, and this could inform clinical practice. This paper reports on findings related to the mental health services of a specialist Trust within the UKâs National Health Service (NHS). The analysis studied data of adult patients who underwent diagnosis over the past few years, and developed a diagnostic model for ADHD in adults. The results demonstrate that it is indeed possible to correctly diagnose ADHD patients with promising statistical accuracy.

Participants were 120 patients assessed for dysfunctional anger and impulsive aggression at a hospital-based clinic. Two psychiatrists made independent diagnoses about the presence or absence of ADHD among individuals presenting with symptoms consistent with this disorder. Following the diagnoses, participants were assessed with multiple ADHD measures, including measures based on self-report, observer-report, or a computerized neuropsychological measure (IVA + Plus). With the exception of the IVA + Plus, the ADHD measures significantly differentiated individuals diagnosed with ADHD from individuals who were not so diagnosed. These measures also demonstrated good diagnostic utility via test specific parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, and negative predictive power). A sub-set of measures demonstrated particularly good classification accuracy, with high sensitivity (91 %) and good specificity (81 %).

Six independent criterion performance validity tests (PVTs) were used to establish valid (n = 280) and invalid (n = 37) performance groups. Among the valid group, 229 met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition criteria for ADHD. Non-significant to small correlations emerged between ES, FC, RD, and the criterion PVTs, suggesting these measures are largely independent. The valid group performed significantly better than the invalid group across all three embedded PVTs, with medium to large effects (d = 0.66â0.89). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses similarly revealed that all three PVTs accurately differentiated valid from invalid performance (areas under the curve: .63â.74) with the following optimal cut-scores: ES â¤ 12 (43% sensitivity/90% specificity), FC â¤ 14 (49% sensitivity/92% specificity), RD â¤ 5 (35% sensitivity/90% specificity). Results were identical between the overall sample of adult ADHD referrals and the subsample who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. In sum, these memory-based RAVLT and BVMT-R PVTs were able to accurately identify invalid neuropsychological test performance among adults undergoing evaluation for ADHD, regardless of whether diagnostic criteria for ADHD was met. Although optimal cut-scores generally were consistent with prior literature, sensitivity was generally less robust than prior cross-validation studies with mixed clinical and medicolegal samples.

In this study, we investigate if a distinct pattern of neuromuscular dysregulation previously reported in ADHD, can help identifying ADHD in psychiatric patients with diverse and complex symptoms. METHOD: We explored the impact of neuromuscular dysregulation, as measured by The Motor Function Neurologic Assessment (MFNU), on the likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD, affective disorder, anxiety disorder, or personality disorder among adults (n = 115) referred to a psychiatric outpatient clinic. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that neuromuscular dysregulation was significantly associated with ADHD diagnosis only (OR 1.15, p < .01), and not with affective-, anxiety-, or personality disorders. Sensitivity and specificity for ADHD at different MFNU scores is provided. CONCLUSIONS: A test of neuromuscular dysregulation may promote diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ADHD from other psychiatric disorders in patients with an overlapping symptom picture.
