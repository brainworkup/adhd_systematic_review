Preface
   The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of systematic reviews to assist public- and private-sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of healthcare in the United States. These reviews provide comprehensive, science-based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new healthcare technologies and strategies. 
   Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence-based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/about/epc/evidence-synthesis
   AHRQ expects that these systematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the healthcare system as a whole. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

Executive Summary[DZ4]









1. Introduction[DZ5]
1.1 Background[AM6][DZ7]
   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by persistent symptoms in the domains of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.1 Clinically significant symptoms, especially inattention, persist into adulthood in most individuals.1-5 The lifetime prevalence of ADHD is approximately 5.3%,6 although epidemiological studies that have not required a childhood onset have suggested that its prevalence in adults may be as high as 6.7%.7-10 Although many adults with ADHD adopt lifestyles that help compensate for their symptoms, they often need to exert excess energy to overcome impairments. They are often distressed by their inability to realize their full potential and by persistent symptoms of restlessness, erratic moods, and poor self-esteem.11, 12 Impaired productivity because of poor time management, procrastination, and distractibility can limit work productivity and lower overall quality of life.11 The mainstay of treatments for ADHD in adults are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications, especially stimulant medications. More than 2% of US adults misuse stimulant medications, mostly to aid concentration and alertness,13 but also as a form of substance abuse. A wide range of other treatments have been developed and may be effective, including psychotherapy, psychosocial interventions, cognitive training, neurofeedback, neuromodulation, and nutritional supplements. Even when ADHD treatments prove helpful, however, long-term adherence is often poor.14-17 Whether treatments that improve the core symptoms also improve any problems associated with ADHD is unclear, and the long-term effectiveness in adults is generally unknown.
ADHD is most often first diagnosed in elementary or middle school age years or, less commonly, in high school or college when experiencing difficulty meeting academic demands. It can also be first diagnosed in adulthood, when impairments in attention, organization, and impulsivity produce recurrent problems with occupational, social, or family functioning. Adult diagnosis is often difficult because the outward manifestations most readily evident to others, hyperactivity and impulsivity, often improve during adolescence and no longer meet diagnostic criteria.18 The symptoms of inattention (e.g., easy distractibility, poor organization, being "spacey," avoiding and trouble completing tasks that require sustained attention, losing things, forgetfulness) are more subtle and may not reach the level of obvious functional impairment until adulthood, within an occupational setting or a marriage.
    The diagnosis of ADHD in adults, as in childhood, is complicated by the overlap of symptoms with other disorders.19, 20 Attention and concentration, for example, can be impaired in persons who have depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse. Hyperactivity can be confused with anxiety-related behaviors and the excessive movements of tic and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Impulsivity is often prominent in bipolar and substance use disorders. The accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD is further complicated by a substantial and growing number of individuals, especially college students21 and highly driven working professionals, who seek stimulant medications to aid cognitive performance. Stimulants have long been known to improve sustained attention and reduce distractibility in healthy individuals who do not have ADHD,22-26 prompting some success-oriented individuals to feign symptoms to their doctors or on neuropsychological test assessments. Claims of exceptional diagnostic performance of these tools, the differing measures of performance, and the differing performance characteristics of different versions of a given tool,27 are controversial and often confusing to clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders. In addition, whether the performance of diagnostic tools varies with the characteristics of the ADHD participants or comparator sample is unknown.28 These diagnostic challenges can complicate the accurate and reliable diagnosis of adult ADHD even for experienced mental health clinicians.
   Despite established diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), diagnosing ADHD in adults remains challenging due to the frequent absence of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms, the subtlety of inattention symptoms, the inaccuracy of recall in adults for their retrospective assessments of ADHD symptoms in childhood (required to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria), and the common overlap with other mental health conditions.18, 19, 29 The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, developed primarily for children, may not be suitable for adult diagnosis, and the requirement of symptoms beginning before age 12 has been debated.30-34 Furthermore, the accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD is complicated by the large number of individuals,21-26 including healthy college students,35, 36 who seek stimulant medications to improve cognitive performance, The absence of a true "gold-standard" diagnosis, the variability in performance of diagnostic tools among clinicians and settings, and the lack of clear practice guidelines further add to diagnostic complexity.37-40 
   The diagnosis of ADHD in adults is often made by primary care providers and nurse practitioners41 rather than specialists, and the dispensing of ADHD medications has been increasing steadily, highlighting the need for effective diagnostic tools and guidelines.33 The existing standards and guidelines for diagnosing ADHD in adults are limited, and the use of diagnostic tools and assessments varies widely in practice.42-44 No guidelines for the diagnosis of adults with ADHD have thus far been developed in the United States, though one is in development.45 The accuracy of diagnosis directly affects the management and treatment of ADHD, as well as the prevention of medication misuse. The diagnostic accuracy of tools and assessments used in adult ADHD diagnosis is unclear, however, and their performance may vary depending on the characteristics of the ADHD participants and comparator samples.27, 28 
1.2 Purpose and Scope[DZ8]
   This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the diagnostic tools used to diagnose ADHD in adults to inform patients, clinicians, and policy makers. Initiated by the FDA, this Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report will document the available evidence. We will explore the effects of the setting and participant characteristics that may influence the diagnostic performance A contextual question is which tools are frequently being used in current clinical practice. 
   
   


2. Methods[DZ9][DZ10]
   The systematic review followed a systematic review protocol that outlines the methods in detail.46 The methodology followed the EPC Methods Guide.47 The review is registered as Registration CRD42025638106. The project was supported by a multidisciplinary technical expert panel (TEP). The panel was designed to provide different perspectives of a broad group of stakeholders to ensure the evidence report on diagnosis of ADHD is relevant to a large audience. The panel includes experts specifically in adult ADHD and considered the needs of affected patients as well as family members. 
2.2 Key Questions[DZ11]
   The systematic review was guided by the following key questions: 
* Key Question 1. What is the comparative diagnostic accuracy, unintended consequences and impact of tools that can be used in the primary care practice setting or by specialists to diagnose ADHD among adults?
o Key Question 1a: How does the comparative diagnostic accuracy of these tools vary by clinical setting, including primary care or specialty clinic, or patient characteristics, including age, sex, cultural background, and risk factors associated with ADHD?
   In addition, a contextual question provided additional information:
* Contextual Question. How frequently are the various tools to diagnose ADHD in adults currently being used? 
2.3 Logic Model[DZ12]
   Figure 1 illustrates the scope of the review.
Figure 1. Logic Model for Diagnosis of ADHD in Adults

Notes: ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, KQ key question

   The model shows the population of interest (adults with suspected ADHD) and depicts the key question (diagnostic test performance) and sub-question (effect modifiers). The model also shows outcomes, ranging from side effects of the testing modality (e.g., relevant for invasive tests), to intermediate outcomes such as the diagnostic accuracy established in the study, to final outcomes such as the impact of a diagnosing or misdiagnosing ADHD.
2.4 Search Strategy
   The literature search for studies on diagnosing ADHD in adults used a combination of known tests to diagnose ADHD and general search terms for diagnostic accuracy studies to identify novel tools. We searched PubMed (biomedical literature), EMBASE (pharmacology emphasis), and PsycINFO (psychological research) without search date restriction and restricted to English language. The search strategy was peer reviewed within the EPC program. We used existing reviews for reference-mining; these were identified through the same databases plus searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Campbell Collaboration, and PROSPERO. We also searched the ECRI repository, G-I-N, and ClinicalKey for published guidelines and used these for reference-mining cited literature. All searches will be updated during the public comment period.
   In addition, we leveraged technical experts to ensure that relevant research studies have been identified. We provided a list of included studies, together with all associated publications, and a list of excluded studies to facilitate this process. A Supplemental Evidence And Data for Systematic Reviews (SEADs) portal was available from January 10 to February 4 for this review. Additional data and publications suggested to us from any source, including peer and public review, will be screened applying the outlined eligibility criteria.

   Included ADHD tests were not limited to a set of pre-specified tools; instead, the review documents all tools that have been evaluated in the scientific literature and for which diagnostic accuracy evidence exists. There are no publication date restrictions. Studies with data exclusively published in non-English language publications were excluded to ensure transparency. We obtained all published reports providing data on a study (a study is defined by the included participants), including trial records and multiple publications, and consolidated the information into one study record.
2.5.1 Screening Process
   We used an online database designed for systematic reviews to screen the literature search output. The team designed detailed citation and full text screening forms to ensure a transparent, consistent, and unambiguous approach. All citations were screened by two independent literature reviewers. Citations found to be potentially relevant by at least one reviewer were obtained as full text. All citations were also screened by a DistillerSR software machine learning algorithm trained by the human reviewers to ensure that no relevant citation was missed. Any citations identified as potentially relevant by the algorithm that were not selected for full text publication review were rescreened for relevance by an independent literature reviewer.
   Full text screening applied the detailed eligibility criteria. Training ensured a shared understanding of all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text publications were screened by two independent reviewers to reduce errors and bias, and any discrepancy was resolved through discussion in the review team. The screening decisions and reasons for exclusion of publications were tracked in the online database and citation management software. These citations were shared with the technical expert panel and were documented with the review to ensure that the literature flow was transparent and objective. 
2.6 Data Extraction[DZ14]
   The data abstraction captured detailed information about eligible studies. One literature reviewer abstracted the data and an experienced methodologist checked the data for accuracy and completeness. We designed a detailed data extraction form in the software DistillerSR.
   The data abstraction documented the targeted population, abstracted reported characteristics for all participants (participants with ADHD and those without). We documented the clinical setting, abstracted the method of establishing the reference standard (a clinical ADHD diagnosis), and abstracted diagnostic tool characteristics (format, name of the tool, employed cut offs, use of a training and validation set). We collected data for a diagnostic meta-analysis where possible (i.e., number of false positives, number of false negatives) along with the summary diagnosis accuracy measures reported by the authors such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, positive predictive value. We differentiated between the diagnostic accuracy to diagnose ADHD and the diagnostic accuracy to detect faking ADHD. For all studies reporting multiple results, we selected the best accuracy performance model (either based on the authors' opinion, accuracy data, or trying to maximize sensitivity and specificity simultaneously).
2.7 Risk of Bias Assessment[DZ15]
   The critical appraisal for individual studies applied criteria consistent with QUADAS 2.48 QUADAS-2 evaluates four domains: patient selection, index test characteristics, reference standard quality, as well as flow and timing: 
* Patient selection: The domain addresses whether the selection of patients could have introduced bias, taking into account whether the study enrolled a consecutive or random sample, whether the data are not based on a retrospective case-control design, and whether the study avoided inappropriate or problematic exclusions from the patient pool. 
* Index test: The domain evaluates whether the conduct or interpretation of the test could have introduced bias, taking into account whether the results of the test were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard and whether any thresholds or cut-offs were pre-specified (e.g., instead of determined during the study to maximize diagnostic performance). 
* Reference standard: The domain evaluates whether the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation may have introduced bias, taking into account the quality of the reference standard in correctly classifying the condition and whether the reference standard test results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test. 
* Flow and timing: The last domain evaluates whether the conduct of the study may have introduced bias. The assessment takes into account whether the interval between the test and the reference standard was appropriate, whether all patients received the reference standard and whether they received the same reference standard, and whether all patients were included in the analysis. 
   For each domain, we assessed the potential risk of bias in the study in order to identify high risk of bias and low risk of bias studies. One literature reviewer assessed risk of bias, and a methodologist reviewed individual studies and rating across studies to ensure accuracy and consistency of ratings. As outlined in the applicability section, we also evaluated for each study and appraisal domain whether there were concerns regarding the applicability of the study results to the review question. This encompassed whether the patients included in the studies matched the review question; whether the test, its conduct, or interpretation differed from the review question; or whether the target condition as defined by the reference standard fully matched the review question. The information was incorporated into the strength of evidence assessment.
2.8 Data Synthesis and Analysis[DZ16]
   We answered the key question with the available evidence. We broadly differentiated diagnostic tools as 
* Self reports 
* Peer reports 
* Neuropsychological tests
* Neuroimaging 
* EEG
* Biomarker
* Observational data
* Clinician tools
* Combination predictions using more than one modality
* Tests to detect feigning of ADHD
   We documented comparative effect results where studies compared the performance of more than one tool. In addition, we documented the range of results reported in studies within each tool category (e.g., self reports). We documented the diagnostic accuracy results for all outcomes as reported by the authors in the individual studies. Sensitivity estimates were documented together with specificity estimates given that the estimates are not independent. A detailed evidence table displays key characteristics, the reference standard, psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy outcomes for all included studies. In addition, we abstracted the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives where clearly reported for use in a diagnostic meta-analysis. All studies were considered for the narrative synthesis accompanying the summary of findings table.
   We documented the results for available diagnostic tools across studies in a comprehensive summary of findings table documenting all assessed outcomes related to the diagnosis, reliability, and impact of the tool. Key outcomes for the summary of findings table were determined with the help of the TEP:
* Misdiagnosis (risk of missed condition that can appear as ADHD)
* Sensitivity
* Specificity
* Administration and scoring time
* Inter-rater reliability 
* Costs
* Diagnostic concordance of primary care provider with specialist
   The synthesis took study limitations and the risk of bias of individual studies contributing to estimates into account. In particular, we determined whether summary estimates corresponded to data reported in low risk of bias studies or were primarily based on high risk of studies.
   To address the sub-question, we reported on subgroup results for different clinical settings (differentiating general and specialty care settings), patient characteristics (differentiating sex, age, cultural background, and comorbidity groups), and ADHD presentation (differentiating predominantly inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, combined). We assessed whether these variables can explain heterogeneity identified in results across studies.
   To address the contextual question we documented the frequency of identified research for each individual tool. In addition, we summarized data sources that reported on the frequency of tool use in clinical practice with emphasis on the U.S. healthcare setting in the discussion.
2.9 Grading the Strength of the Body of Evidence[DZ17]
   We applied the EPC strength of evidence criteria to evaluate the body of evidence. In determining the quality of the body of evidence, the following domains were evaluated:
* Study limitations: The extent to which studies reporting on a particular outcome were likely to be protected from bias. The aggregate risk of bias across individual studies reporting an outcome was considered; graded as low, medium, or high level of study limitations.
* Inconsistency: The extent to which studies reported the same direction and/or magnitude of effects for a particular outcome; graded as consistent, inconsistent, or unknown (in the case of a single study or the absence of studies).
* Indirectness: Determines whether the test and the comparator were directly (i.e., within studies) or indirectly (e.g., across studies) compared. The domain was graded as direct or indirect.
* Imprecision: Describes the level of certainty of the estimate of effect for a particular outcome, where a precise estimate is one that allows a clinically useful conclusion. The domain was graded as precise or imprecise. 
* Reporting bias: Publication bias, selective outcome reporting, and selective analysis reporting are types of reporting bias. Reporting bias is difficult to assess as systematic identification of unpublished evidence is challenging. 
   A final strength of evidence grade for each evidence statement was assigned by evaluating and weighing the combined results of the above domains. We differentiated an overall grade of high, moderate, low, or insufficient according to a four-level scale:
* High: We are very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has few or no deficiencies. We believe that the findings are stable (i.e., another study would not change the conclusions).
* Moderate: We are moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has some deficiencies. We believe that the findings are likely to be stable, but some doubt remains.
* Low: We have limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has major or numerous deficiencies (or both). We believe that additional evidence is needed before concluding either that the findings are stable or that the estimate of effect is close to the true effect.
* Insufficient: We have no evidence, we are unable to estimate an effect, or we have no confidence in the estimate of effect for this outcome. No evidence is available, or the body of evidence has unacceptable deficiencies, precluding reaching a conclusion.
   Summary tables included reasons for downgrading or upgrading the strength of evidence. The strength of evidence assessment documented uncertainty and communicated our confidence in the evidence statements that can be drawn from the literature.
2.10 Assessing Applicability
   Results are based on the international literature and applicability ratings provided assessments regarding the generalizability of samples, settings, and tool results for U.S. clinical practice. For each study, we assessed the population included in the study to identify studies with narrow eligibility criteria (e.g., looking for a specific subgroup of ADHD participants only), studies that excluded participants with comorbidities, or studies that had more complex participants than typically seen in the community (e.g., dually diagnosed participants). We assessed whether studies described tools not used as recommended or commonly used in practice, the presence of highly trained test team or set up (e.g., analysis via complex machine learning models), or assessors that were not qualified for the assessment. We assessed whether the reference standard was ambiguous, different from standard clinical practice, or insufficiently described.

3.1 Results of Literature[AM23][SH24] Search
The flow diagram documents the literature flow of the systematic review.
Figure 2. Study Flow Diagram




























   We identified 114 studies meeting inclusion criteria[SH25]. The earliest identified study was published in 1998.[AM26]  Studies evaluated tools in Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, USA, or combined evaluations in multiple countries. Sample sizes varied widely, from a dozen participants to large samples with over a thousand participants, respectively.50-52 Studies included participants diagnosed with ADHD and compared to different non-ADHD samples. These included neurotypical adults not diagnosed with ADHD, adults from a clinical sample evaluated or diagnosed for another clinical condition, and/or adults feigning ADHD. Half of the included studies (51%) included a neurotypical group of adults that did not meet criteria for ADHD and in some cases were also selected specifically because they also never had a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Many studies (40%) compared to a clinical sample of participants that was being evaluated for another clinical condition. In addition, two studies each compared to participants with autism,53, 54 participants with conduct disorder or anger dysregulation,55, 56 or participants with depression,57, 58 respectively. A quarter (23%) of the identified studies included participants identified or specifically trained to pretend to have ADHD. Studies varied in whether they included an additional group (e.g., a neurotypical or clinical sample), but some studies included only participants feigning ADHD, which were compared to participants with a diagnosis of ADHD.59-62
   The risk of bias across studies is shown in figure 3.

   The[SH27] applicability assessment is summarized in figure 4.
Figure 4. Applicability 

    [SH28]
    Identified studies reported on self-report questionnaires, peer review tools, neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalogram (EEG), diverse biomarkers, clinician tools, combinations of modalities, and tools to identify feigning ADHD. Studies reported on the success of identifying ADHD, success in identifying feigning and exaggerating of ADHD symptoms, or both. 
3.2  Results of Key Question 1 comparative diagnostic accuracy, unintended consequences, and impact of tools that can be used in the primary care practice setting or by specialists to diagnose ADHD among adults?
   We identified a number of studies that included multiple tools used alone or in combination. However, not all studies reported diagnostic performance for all tools and combinations, and only selected studies allowed direct comparisons. 
   The 11 studies with head-to-head comparisons between modalities compared primarily self report questionnaires with other modalities: compared to parent rating,{#685} peer report,{#5349}{#10626} a combination of self and other rating,{#949}{#5349}{#10626} neuropsychological tests,{#5349}{#870} a combination of self report and EEG;{#10732} and a clinician tool.{#4185}{#5349} Three studies compared neuropsychological test results to combinations of input;{#10710}{#711}{#325} one compared a neuropsychological test and one compared EEG data under Go-NoGo task conditions with task performance indicators{#73} Table 2 documents the results for the comparative studies.

   Several studies compared multiple tests, but not all reported coefficients for every test. All available comparative results across test modalities (e.g., combinations of variables vs neuropsychological test results alone) are documented in the summary of findings table.
Combination
Seven studies reported on a combination of input from different modalities.{#325}{#949}{#5100}{#5349}{#10626}{#10710}{#10732} Several included self and informant symptom ratings, and some also used demographic variables, neuropsychological assessment results, or EEG data. Studies varied in their complexity of the combination; one study, supported by machine learning, used 93 variables.{#5100} The Appendix Table A1 documents results for all studies that evaluated a combination. The table shows the specific combinations used to correctly diagnose ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
Self Reports
Forty-one studies reported at least one self report measure evaluated for its performance in diagnosing ADHD. The studies reported on numerous self report measures: ADHD Rating Scale, AHA, ALS-SF, APQ, ARS, ASRS, ASSET-BS, BAARS-IV, BADDS, CAARS, CBS, EarlyDetect Questionnaire, IPDE-SQ, PAI, PDI-4, SR-WRAADDS, and WURS (see evidence table in the appendix for more information). The Appendix Table A2 documents results for all studies that evaluated a written self report for the diagnosis of ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
Peer Ratings
Two studies evaluated peer reports.{#685}{#10626} One of the studies asked parents to rate their young adults with autism using the CAARS-P and the ABC (Aberrant Behavior Checklist).{#685} The other study included parent ratings of undergraduates using the BAARS-IV (Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV).{#10526} The Appendix Table A3 documents results for the small number of studies that evaluated a written peer report for the diagnosis of ADHD. In both cases, the peer report was a parent rating of young adults. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
Neuropsychological Assessment
Twenty-six studies reported on the performance of neuropsychological assessment to diagnose ADHD. Studies evaluated test batteries such as AQT, BQSS, C-CPT, DII, IVA, MOXO-dCPT, QbTest, SCWT, SNST, or the performance of individual tasks such as the Go-No-Go task or WAIS-IV Processing Speed Index. The Appendix Table A4 documents results for all neuropsychological test evaluated to diagnose ADHD. The index test description shows the evaluated test selection that showed the best performance, together with all administered tests. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
Neuroimaging
Five studies evaluated neuroimaging.{#28}{#134}{#812}{#870}{#1011} Studies used Brain Perfusion SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography),{#28} 3-D SPECT,{#812} structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging,{#134} and resting state functional MRI.{#970}{#1011} The Appendix Table A5 documents results of studies that evaluated neuroimaging for the diagnosis of ADHD. The table provides details on the final selection model where reported. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
EEG
Eleven studies evaluated EEG (electroencephalogram) data.{#73}{#334}{#436}{#448}{#454}{#640}{#642}{#722}{#729}{#840}{#425} Studies tested very different conditions, ranging from analyzing resting state EEG,{#448}{#722} event-related potentials during neuropsychological tasks,{#73}{#640} to EEG recording during transcranial magnetic stimulation.{#334} The Appendix Table A6 documents results for the studies that evaluated the use of EEG data for the diagnosis of ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
Biomarker
Five studies evaluated biomarkers other than EEG or neuroimaging-based.{#327}{#417}{#832}{#5003}{#5685} Studies evaluated genetic marker,{#327} eye tracking,{#417} blood oxidative status,{#832} physiological data from a wearable device,{#5003} or used MFNU (Motor Function Neurological Assessment){#5685} to diagnose ADHD. The Appendix Table A7 documents results for the small number of studies that evaluated the use of biomarkers other than neuroimaging or EEG for the diagnosis of ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).
Clinician Tool
Three studies reported on a clinician interview or questionnaire that was assessed for congruence with an external reference standard.{#684}{#4185}{#5349} Studies evaluated the MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview),{#4185} MINI-Plus,{#684} and the CAARS-O (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales){#5349 in clinical samples. The reference standards were assessments from trained clinicians,{#684} the recorded chart diagnosis,{#4185} or clinical consensus meeting with multiple clinicians.{#5349} 
Key Question 1a: How does the comparative diagnostic accuracy of tools vary by clinical setting or patient characteristics?
   Because raw data for diagnostic accuracy were often not reported, we were not able to detect effect modifiers in meta-regressions by adding variables to the meta-analytic model. Results are based on subgroups as reported by the authors and analyses conducted within the original studies.
   Clinical setting: Half of the identified studies were conducted in specialty care (n=55). The next most frequent setting was college (n=37). Very few studies were conducted in primary care (n=2). In addition, none of the identified studies analyzed the effect of the setting on the diagnostic process. Hence the question which tests should be used in primary care is difficult to answer. However, several studies addressed the effect of the reference standard and comparator sample, i.e., study characteristics. In addition, several studies addressed the effect of comorbidities. Although primarily a patient characteristic, participants evaluated for other clinical conditions was more typical of a specialty care clinical setting.
   Reference standard and comparator sample: Three studies addressed the effect of the method of establishing a clinical ADHD diagnosis, but all addressed different aspects. One study comparing self reports and neuropsychological tests highlighted that diagnostic accuracy measures were high when comparing ADHD-diagnosed participants to the general population but were less effective when distinguishing ADHD from other psychiatric conditions, with overlapping scores noted for anxiety and depression.{#870} Similarly, a self report study reported a high false-positive rate in patients with depression.{#212} Another self-report study reported that comorbidities such as anxiety and depression were associated with elevated scores on scales which may overlap with ADHD symptoms and potentially contribute to misclassification and highlighted the importance of considering comorbid conditions during assessment.{#495} One study evaluating neuromuscular assessment reported that they found several patients with subthreshold ADHD in a clinical sample suggesting possible diagnostic overlap and the need for further evaluation.{#5685} 
   ADHD presentation: Four studies addressed diagnosis in different presentations of ADHD with some conflicting results. One-self report study reported that diagnostic accuracy did not significantly vary across ADHD presentations/subtypes (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined) but noted that combined type ADHD was the most frequently identified subtype, which could influence overall sensitivity and specificity estimates.{#857} Similarly, another study reported that sensitivity and specificity were consistent across ADHD presentation types (inattentive, hyperactive, and combined), but noted that misdiagnosis rates were slightly higher for the inattentive subtype in self-reports compared to clinician diagnoses, and inter-rater reliability between self-report and clinical ratings was moderate, with higher concordance for combined presentation.{#5176} Another self-report study highlighted that sensitivity for the inattentive subtype was 100 percent on the Inattentive Symptoms subscale, with specificity at 25%.{#490} One self-report study pointed out that inattention symptoms were more predictive of ADHD persistence into adulthood than hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms; and individuals with the combined-type ADHD in childhood were more likely to retain a diagnosis in adulthood, whereas hyperactive-impulsive presentations were more likely to remit.{#444}
   Participant age: Several studies reported on the effect of the age of the participants or specifically on the age at diagnosis, but studies focused on different aspects. A self report study reported that executive functioning impairments were more predictive of ADHD persistence in older adults, while hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms were more prevalent in younger adults, suggesting age-related shifts in symptom expression and diagnostic criteria applicability; sensitivity and specificity of ADHD diagnoses were higher in younger adults (18-30 years) compared to older adults (31-44 years), likely due to better recall of childhood symptoms and reduced cognitive decline in memory-based reporting.{#444} A self report and neuropsychological test study reported that age was inversely correlated with scores on scales for attention and effort, suggesting that older participants exhibited fewer ADHD-related symptoms, potentially reflecting developmental improvements in executive functioning.{#870} One study did not comment on differential effects on the diagnosis, but suggested that a potential biomarker, oxidative stress, may increase with the duration of the disease.{#832} Another study found that age represented as independent variable in a multiple regression did not significantly influence parameters measured by the QbTest.{#111} A further study reported that ADHD diagnosis based on CAARS-S or MINI were not correlated with age.{#4185}
   Participant sex: Several studies reported on the effect of the sex of the participants on the diagnostic performance, but studies reported conflicting results. One EEG study reported lower sensitivity in females compared to males.{#425} A neuroimaging study noted that classification performance was higher in the male-only subgroup compared to the mixed-gender subgroup, suggesting that male ADHD patients may have more significant neuroanatomical deviations from controls.{#134} A self report study did not find lower sensitivity but lower specificity in females versus males.{#960} One study concluded that sex did not influence parameters of the neuropsychological test.{#111} A self report study did not detect differences in sensitivity and specificity between sexes.{#1916} A study reporting on a self report and a clinician interview noted that ADHD diagnosis based on the tests were not correlated with sex.{#4185}
   Participant ethnicity: None of the studies stratified diagnostic performance by race or ethnicity.
   Comorbidities: Multiple studies reported on the effect of comorbidities in participants with ADHD on diagnostic performance, but results and conclusions differed. One college study reported that comorbidities contributed to challenges in specificity but not sensitivity and that functional impairment was higher in participants with comorbid conditions.{#490} Similarly, a study in addiction centers reported on variability in specificity values across subgroups while sensitivity remained similar.{#942} Another study reported reduced specificity in participants with overlapping symptoms of borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder in neuropsychiatric clinics.{#220} One study reported lower sensitivity and higher specificity in participants with comorbidity in a mental health center.{#536} Two studies in outpatient centers reported that diagnostic performance was unaffected by comorbidities.{#111}{#495} Some studies pointed out the high prevalence of comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety.{#857}{#4485}{#444}{#323} One study suggested that participants with ADHD and depression reported higher levels of anxiety.{#212}
Key Question 1 Summary of Findings
Despite the large number of studies, many did not report on the exact number of true positives, true negatives etc. The most common metrics were the author reported sensitivity. Given that sensitivity and specificity are not independent of each other, we plotted both for all reported tests in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Sensitivity and Specificity of Tests

   The figure visualizes the much larger evidence base for self reports compared to all other modalities. The figure also illustrates the wide variability reported in the individual studies for the same modality. In addition, the visualization shows that tests were sometimes able to maximize sensitivity or specificity, but not both. Finally, with few exceptions, the evaluated tests were limited in their success of detecting a clinical diagnosis of ADHD.
   The summary of findings table (Table 3) provides a synthesis of the results for the key outcomes. Direct comparisons between test modalities are shown first, followed by the test performance for individual tests, and the summary of the subquestion. The summary of findings table shows results for the key outcomes for which at least one study with data was identified. The clinical misdiagnosis results were limited to studies reporting on clinical samples and/or studies comparing to another clinical condition such as anxiety.
   To broadly characterize the magnitude of effects, we described false positive rate as moderate when the majority of studies reported values below 20 and as substantial for rates close to 50 percent of incorrectly classified. We described sensitivity and specificity as fair for values below 80, as acceptable above 80 but below 90 percent, as good if most values fell between 90 and 95 percent, and as excellent for values above 95 percent. We describe administration time under 30 minutes as short administration. For rater agreement we described kappa below 0.8 and correlations below 0.40 as limited.
   Results of individual studies for all abstracted outcomes are shown in the evidence tables in the appendix.

Notes: KQ key question, N/A not applicable or not available

   We identified numerous studies reporting on the performance of tests for detecting feigning ADHD. Studies used subjective and objective tests. Results are shown in the evidence table in the appendix (Appendix Table A9).
   The included studies did not report on the impact for participants of being correctly or incorrectly diagnosed. Studies reported only on the performance of the tests but not the effect a diagnosis (or a misdiagnosis) had on participants or similar.
   None of the included studies reported on unintended consequences, adverse events, adverse effects, or side effects of the diagnostic tools, including blood-based biomarker, EEG, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological test studies.

Test description: Combination prediction model with BAARS parent and self rating of current and childhood ADHD diagnosis
Machine learning: No
Validation dataset: No
Reference standard: Clinical diagnosis
Diagnosed with ADHD based on the Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV, which included structured diagnostic interviews separately administered to students and their parents by trained graduate-level clinicians under supervision, requiring endorsement of at least five current symptoms in two or more settings and six childhood symptoms before high school
Diagnosed by: Specialist (e.g., mental health) Psychologists
Timing: Concurrent
Diagnostic accuracy summary: Parent ratings of childhood inattention had the highest predictive validity (AUC 0.79), outperforming self-report (AUC 0.56). 
Self-reports had high sensitivity (89%) but low specificity (30%), leading to a high false-positive rate.
The prediction model with both parent and student ratings of current symptoms and parent ratings of childhood symptoms accurately classified 88.9% of individuals who had a diagnosis of ADHD and 63.3% of individuals who did not have a diagnosis.

Test description: Integration of CAARS-E (Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale - ADHD Index), the AQ10 (Autism Quotient - 10), and the QbTest (computerized Continuous Performance Test with motion tracking) to differentiate ADHD from Autism Spectrum Disorder
Machine learning: No
Validation dataset: Unclear
Reference standard: Clinical diagnosis
Participants diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist establishing current and long-term diagnosis using DSM-5
Diagnosed by: Specialist (e.g., mental health) Psychiatrist
Timing: Prior diagnosis
Diagnostic accuracy summary: QbTotal yielded the highest AUC value 0.87 (classified as 'good'). ROCs indicate that at equivalent sensitivity of around 80%, QbTotal demonstrates superior specificity compared with CAARS-E in differentiating ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. 
CAARS-E AUC was .77 ('fair') in differentating ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. 
QbTest added to clinical ratings may improve the differentiation of ADHD and autism spectrum disorder in adults.

Participants with a positive ADHD screen demonstrated greater functional impairments and higher levels of anxiety compared to those without ADHD, suggesting that functional impairments are more pronounced in those with comorbid conditions. The high false-positive rate was attributed to symptom overlap, particularly with inattention and anxiety in depressive disorders. MDD participants with ADHD symptomatology reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and rumination compared to those without ADHD, demonstrating the impact of comorbid conditions on symptom scores.

Sensitivity and specificity of ADHD diagnoses were higher in younger adults (18-30 years) compared to older adults (31-44 years), likely due to better recall of childhood symptoms and reduced cognitive decline in memory-based reporting.
The inattention symptoms were more predictive of ADHD persistence into adulthood than hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms, with 94.9% of persistent ADHD cases meeting inattention criteria, compared to only 34.6% meeting hyperactivity-impulsivity criteria.

20% of participants with ADHD had comorbid conditions, including anxiety (7%), depression (5%), and other disorders. Still, these comorbidities did not significantly affect the sensitivity (55%) or specificity (86%) of the PAI scales. Comorbidities such as anxiety and depression were associated with elevated scores on specific PAI subscales (ANX-C, DEP), which may overlap with ADHD symptoms and potentially contribute to misclassification. The findings highlight the importance of considering comorbid conditions during assessment to minimize misdiagnosis and improve diagnostic accuracy.

Diagnostic accuracy summary: College students with ADHD reported significantly more ADHD symptoms and academic concerns than their peers without ADHD, but none of the 18 ADHD symptoms or six academic concerns were sensitive and specific to ADHD. Sensitivity (84%) and specificity (70%) of the self-report tool were calculated based on clinical diagnosis as the reference standard, indicating that self-reports were moderately effective at identifying individuals with ADHD but less accurate at ruling out false positives. Functional impairment (academic challenges) was also higher in the ADHD group, although similar complaints were noted among non-ADHD participants, indicating poor specificity for these academic concerns.

Test description: QbTest, a continuous performance test measuring inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity combined with activity levels which are measured by an infrared motion tracking camera; consists of unconditional identical pair paradigm to avoid floor to ceiling effects; participants are asked to sit 1m from a monitor which the infrared motion tracking camera is attached to, and to hold a handheld responder; participants are instructed (by standardized instruction on the screen, and verbally) that there will be time for a 5-minute practice before they begin, and that accuracy and speed is the objective; consists of 600 stimuli presented on the monitor, each stimulus is present for 200ms, followed by an interval of 2000ms; stimulus consists of red or blue circles and squares; participants are instructed to only press the responder when the stimuli they see matches the previous stimuli in color or shape; attention is measured by number of correctly identified targets, reaction time, and variability of reaction time. Impulsivity is measured by incorrect responses, and hyperactivity is measured using the motion- tracking system using the infrared camera (captures movement by tracking a reflective headband); camera captures movement throughout the whole of the task at a frequency of 50 samples a second and with spatial resolution of 1/27 mm per infrared camera unit

Four shapes were shown 5 cm from the word stimulus and were positioned perpendicularly to it, 3 were similar and one was different, the colour font of the shapes were either all blue or all yellow in 50% of runs, in the other 3 were yellow and 1 blue; in each of the shapes a line of 2.5 cm length was presented and was positioned at either -45 degrees , 0 degrees , 45 degrees or 90 degrees; participants were asked to respond to the orientation of the line in the odd shape by pressing the corresponding key and the hence colours were irrelevant to measure a subtype of selective attention known as perceptual selectivity

Classification performance was higher in the male-only subgroup compared to the mixed-gender subgroup, suggesting that male ADHD patients may have more significant neuroanatomical deviations from controls​.  However, the authors cautioned that they could not conduct female-only analyses due to the limited sample size, and the observed differences might reflect the use of a more homogeneous sample rather than actual sex-based differences in diagnostic performance​.
12 ADHD participants and one healthy control (HC) had comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, but the impact of these comorbidities on diagnostic performance was not explicitly analyzed. However, the authors excluded participants with a history of major psychiatric disorders (except mild depression, anxiety disorders, and disruptive behavior disorders), as well as those with prior ADHD treatment, drug abuse, or general medical conditions.

Test description: Effort tests and symptoms validity tests are designed to assess the credibility of self-reported symptoms and detect intentional exaggeration or malingering. These tests include validity indices like the Negative Impression Management (NIM), Malingering Index (MAL), and Rogers Discriminant Function (RDF) in the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), which evaluate patterns of responses to identify response distortion. By analyzing these patterns, the tests differentiate genuine cases of ADHD from individuals feigning symptoms, providing insights into the reliability of the reported symptoms.

[DZ1]Report length: Be as concise as possible. Excluding front matter, references, and appendices, small reviews should not exceed 40 pages; medium 60 pages; and large 80 pages. Without prior agreement from the TOO, draft reports outside of these limits will be returned to the EPCs for editing. 
[DZ2]Be judicious; try to limit tables and figures in the body of the report to high-level summaries that can replace longer textual descriptions. Forest plots of key outcomes, for example, can effectively communicate complex information. 
[DZ3]Ideally, limit the appendices to one per report chapter, i.e., Methods Appendix, Results Appendix, etc. If dividing an appendix would make it easier to read, use, and understand, list the report chapter and section in its title, e.g., Methods Appendix: Search Strategies.

[DZ11]Give the full (exact) wording of each Key Question.
Check that Key Questions here map to those in protocol to a reasonable degree. (Changes from originally posted Key Questions are acceptable and modifications of KQs in protocol may also be acceptable.)
[DZ12]Include any logic model used in conducting the review. 
If a logic model is included, the EPC should describe the logic model to help readers understand the logic of the analysis. If an analytic framework was used, it should flow from populations to the important health (or other) outcomes, including patient-important outcomes, that the systematic review will cover. The logic model approach should be discussed with the TOO during the development of the protocol.
[DZ13]·      Use one (or more) tables to document the inclusion and exclusion criteria overall or for specific Key Questions.
·      Explain decisions. Examples may include using or not using various types of observational studies; setting a minimum sample size; inclusion or exclusion of non-English studies or geographic areas; limited search dates; and other considerations appropriate to the topic.
·      Describe (text or tables) any inclusion or exclusion criteria that vary by publication type (e.g., gray literature) or study design (e.g., existing systematic reviews).
·      Describe your process for title and abstract review (or title review, then abstract review) and full-text review. Use descriptive language, rather than Phase 1/2 or Stage 1/2 terminology.
·      Address artificial intelligence or natural language processing here if you used these techniques in the screening process.
·      Explain whether and how you conducted dual review. For example, at least two reviewers independently agreed on selection of eligible studies and achieved consensus on which studies to include; two reviewers selected a sample of eligible studies and achieved good agreement (at least 80 percent), with the remainder selected by one reviewer.
·      Mention any other quality control mechanisms in this process.
[DZ14]Describe the process for data extraction: for example, single reviewer; single reviewer with double checking by a second reviewer; dual, independent review. Also specify the program (such as Systematic Review Data Repository [SRDR], DistillerSR, Excel, or some other program), if any, into which data were abstracted. Describe the key elements of studies that were extracted. Indicate whether you contacted authors when information was missing or unclear.
Consider using the appendix to capture details. Consult with your TOO if you have questions.
[DZ15]Describe the process for risk of bias assessment, including noting the risk of bias tools used in the assessment. 
Important elements to consider in the report include the following. In most cases you should use your best judgment about readability in determining what should go in the report and what should be included in the Methods Appendix. Where noted, elements should only appear in the appendix. Consult with your TOO if you have questions.
·      Describe the methods (decision rules) you used to evaluate risk of bias in individual studies. 
·      Note the primary domains of risk of bias that you used; likely will need different explanations for different types of study designs.
·      Give citations for any published tools or instruments used; cite the AHRQ Methods Guide if relevant.
·      Be clear about whether (and how) risk of bias ratings apply to full studies or outcomes within studies.
·      Give the terms and definitions of the final risk of bias ratings; mention where the study-specific ratings can be found.
·      Say whether you used a dual rating procedure and how you settled disagreements.
Mention whether the EPC conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of studies at high risk of bias on the overall effect estimate.
[DZ16]In the body of the main report, briefly describe key details of the data synthesis and analysis that help readers know what to expect in the results. 
Important elements to consider in the report include the following. In most cases you should use your best judgment about readability in determining what should go in the report and what should be included in the Methods Appendix. Where noted, elements should only appear in the appendix. Consult with your TOO if you have questions.
·      The approach to grouping studies and categorizing interventions (especially in the case of complex interventions).
·      The general approach for data analysis (qualitative and/or quantitative), including specific models used. 
·      Key sensitivity analyses, stratified analyses, and/or meta-regression analyses (include in the main report; consider using the appendix for routine detail).
·      Key assumptions and/or methods for network meta-analyses.
Other elements to consider:
	•	If you provide solely narrative synthesis, explain the reasons and specify that you did no quantitative synthesis.
	•	If you used an existing systematic review in the analyses, specify that in the body of the main report. 
	•	If you did various quantitative analyses, briefly cover the following steps as needed (examples, and not a comprehensive list):
o   Explain the purpose for pooling - do you expect that this will give greater power and precision, or are you doing it to explore heterogeneity.  If the latter, what sources of heterogeneity will you test or explore (date of study, risk of bias, length of follow-up, etc.)? 
o   Explain approaches to pooling. Be explicit about statistical details and numbers of studies needed before undertaking any meta-analysis, how data may have been obtained (e.g., taken from graphs; imputed in some fashion when necessary), and what kinds of information you did not use in meta-analyses.
o   Specify what dependent variable measures you calculated and what outcome measures (e.g., quality of life instruments) you used.
o   Describe any transformation of continuous variables.
o   Describe or justify choices for presenting results (e.g., use of relative risk [RR] vs. odds ratios [OR]; baseline rates; random vs. fixed effects models).
o   Specify the assessments or tests used for heterogeneity.
o   Describe any decision rules for assessing subgroups, and specify which ones were identified a priori (e.g., in Key Questions). If you are imputing any data (e.g. for missing standard error), describe method you used.
o   Address any methods used to assess for publication or selective reporting bias.
[DZ17]In the body of the main report, note any guidance used for grading individual domains or assessing the overall strength of evidence (SOE). Specify the high-priority outcomes that were graded. Consider using the appendix for details regarding the specific domains assessed, the processes for determining the grades, and the levels and definitions of each grade.
Important elements to consider in the report include the following. In most cases you should use your best judgment about readability in determining what should go in the report and what should be included in the Methods Appendix. Where noted, elements should only appear in the appendix. Consult with your TOO if you have questions.
·      Describe the elements of grading the strength of evidence-e.g., five main domains and the additional domains if used, and then overall score. 
·      Cite relevant guidance used to grade the strength of the evidence. If you used GRADEPro software to generate table, cite it.   
·      Describe how you assessed and scored domains -e.g., two independent graders; how they resolved conflict was resolved. Describe any EPC-specific decision rules for how authors assessed each domain.
·      Describe how the EPC assessed publication bias and whether it conducted searches for gray literature, FDA information, or additional information from authors were used to help mitigate the problem.
·      Describe how the EPC reached the overall strength of evidence grades-e.g., process, decision rules, etc. 
·      Use the table below to define the four levels of the overall strength of evidence grade.

[DZ19]Provide a brief roadmap for the Results Chapter (i.e., explain succinctly what is in the chapter and how it is organized). Typically, but not always, results will be organized by Key Question. Ultimately, EPCs should organize this chapter however best supports brevity and understanding, but they should concisely describe the organizational approach here. 
 
Present the final results of literature searches in this chapter. Provide the number and nature (design) of the included studies and the number of participants. For systematic reviews, include the number of studies in the review (refer to the literature flow diagram). Full description of the literature search, and a list of included studies should appear in the Results Appendix. A list of excluded studies and a description of their exclusion justification should appear in the Results Appendix. 
 
Make the headings succinct but clear. When entire Key Questions are too long or complex for headings, shorten or abridge them. Remind readers that they can look back to the Methods Chapter for the full text of questions. 
 
Briefly note what will appear in the report and what can be found in the Results Appendix. For example: 
Below we provide the report results, including the Key Points for each Key Question, and describe the included evidence, as well as the data synthesis and a summary of the strength of evidence. Details on results of literature searches, included studies, and the strength of evidence can be found in the Results Appendix.

[DZ20R19]Description of Included Evidence
Focus on only the key characteristics of the evidence base that shape the findings and are important for understanding the analyses and results. Focus on study, population, and intervention characteristics. Where possible, summarize the relevant key characteristics in tables or figures.
 
Examples of what to present might include the following:
 
·      Numbers of trials or other studies (and numbers of participants) by types of patient populations; types of interventions and comparators; range of outcomes measured; settings; geographic location; and study design features such as sample size, single center vs. multicenter, or whatever particularly relevant study characteristics are important for this systematic review.
·      Numbers of studies with active or inactive comparators (placebo, waitlist, usual care, or sham).
·      Issues related to dose, frequency, or intensity of the intervention.  
·      Issues related to population or setting that may affect generalizability and applicability.
·      Fidelity to the intervention protocol, particularly for topics involving behavioral interventions, health systems, and complex interventions. See Guise et al for a definition of complex interventions.4  
·      Issues related to risk of bias of studies.
·      Numbers of studies or trials that were efficacy trials or effectiveness trials, depending on the type of question.
·      Specify study funding sources: Comment on funding sources of included studies (e.g., number and percentage with industry funding; number and percentage for which no funding source can be ascertained).

[DZ21R19]Key Points
(Note: Key Points for a given Key Question are different than the Main Points in the Evidence Summary)
Key Points constitutes the first of the two required elements of the Results Chapter of a systematic review. (The other required element, Summary of Findings, is described later in this guidance.)
·      Present only the critical analytic findings-not descriptions of the individual studies themselves. Therefore, do not give detailed, study-specific results (e.g., findings, statistical significance, etc.) here.
·      Not all results will be included here. Focus on outcomes identified in the protocol as more important to the decisional dilemma. 
·      Present findings as bulleted points-e.g., one or two complete sentences for each bullet. Use approximately two to six bullets for each Key Question.
·      If many outcomes have insufficient evidence, consider combining all insufficient outcomes into one bullet at the end. This might be done, for instance, as: "Evidence was insufficient for X, Y, Z" or even, "Evidence was insufficient for all other outcomes and subgroups." However, some outcomes with insufficient evidence may be considered "pertinent negatives" (i.e., the fact that evidence is insufficient is important to decision makers); these might have their own Key Point. 
·      Indicate the number and type of studies and the number (N) of patients.
·      Include the direction and strength of evidence pertaining to the findings in any bullet in this section. Do not include statistical data here (no p-values, RRs, ORs, or Confidence Intervals [CIs]). Consider language such as the following examples of which the first is more direct and easier and may be more pertinent for readers):
 
Patients treated with [INTERVENTION X] showed [SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE] improvements in [OUTCOME] compared with those treated with [INTERVENTION Y] based on three RCTs (n=XX) and five prospective cohort studies (n=XX) (moderate strength of evidence).
 
OR
 
High strength of evidence for [SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE] benefit of [INTERVENTION X] vs. [INTERVENTION Y] based on four low risk of bias RCTs (n=XX) with consistent results.

[DZ22R19]Summary of Findings
This is the second required element of each Key Question section in the Results Chapter of a systematic review.
·      Focus on "synthesis" of the results; do not give extensive, study-by-study data in text. The goal of the summary of findings is to show the reader how the evidence leads to the conclusion.
·      Focus on the combination of the components of the evidence that yields a clear picture of the "totality" of the evidence for each Key Question. Refer readers to tables in the main report, in "KQ-specific" appendices, or in evidence tables in another appendix.
·      Each section should include a statement about the direction, magnitude, and strength of evidence (such as from the Key Points) and then describe the type of evidence that led to that summary for the relevant intervention-outcome pair (interventions with similar results can be grouped).
o   Present only information critical to readers' understanding of the EPC's analysis; make this section as easy to read as possible.
o   Focus on information necessary to document evidence for the bulleted Key Points, above.
·      For meta-analyses or similar quantitative analyses, provide text and figures, such as forest plots, bar graphs, bubble charts, and others. If the systematic review has many such analyses, consider presenting only key ones graphically and refer readers to an appendix for others. Be judicious, as figures count toward the page limit. For brevity, summarize the point estimates (CIs, I-squared) for many outcomes and comparisons in a table. 
·      For qualitative/narrative synthesis, where pooled analysis methods cannot be used, provide text and tables (if helpful) that organize findings (direction and magnitude of effect) from included studies to describe patterns in results based on relationships between the characteristics of the individual studies, including the strength of evidence domains (study risk of bias/limitations, directness, consistency, and precision). Describe individual studies only to highlight considerations that might explain a pattern. Only describe individual studies to highlight variation that may explain a pattern.
·      When details about individual studies (design; main findings; risk of bias rating) have not been covered elsewhere and when EPCs believe these details are needed to describe the results adequately (overall or just for specific Key Questions), provide no more than a high-level synthesis in text and present the details only in tables:
o   Consider using pairs of tables for critical studies and information: one presenting study characteristics and risk of bias rating, and one presenting study findings (combine with meta-analysis results where possible).
o   Whatever is not critical to understanding how the results speak to the decisional dilemmas, move to an appendix.
·      Do not repeat detailed study-specific data in text if they appear in tables in the report. Instead, refer readers to the full evidence table in the appendix. 
·      An example design for required summary tables appears below.
o   If quantitative summary is possible, in addition to relative effects, present absolute effects and NNT where possible.
Keep such summary tables to a minimum.

[DZ29]In this Discussion Chapter, emphasize the implications of the findings from the systematic review. Do not simply repeat findings from the Results Chapter without providing interpretation and context. 
 
In the recently completed pilot project, Learning Health Systems-a significant audience for EPC reports-identified three areas that reports should discuss: 1) related findings and clinical guidelines; 2) clinical and policy implications; and 3) caveats, applicability, and limitations. This guidance is intended to elicit a discussion of those areas of interest, among others. The goal for this section is to help readers understand the clinical or practical significance of the findings.
 
Organize this section in the way that best fits your report and covers the conceptual areas outlined here. The report need not use the headings below. If the organization below would introduce redundancy, or if important considerations would be missed, choose a different organization. Discuss with your TOO your plan for organization to facilitate review of the draft and final reports.

Large report: ~8 pages
[DZ31]This section should address the decisional dilemma(s) that underscore the review (as described in the Introduction). This will include a summary of your findings, but results should be described in the context of current practice and what was already known prior to the review, as well as how this report answered the questions for which the answers were unknown. Consider going back to the original nomination to discuss how well the current evidence base answers the question(s) posed by the nominator.
 
Limit the discussion to those findings most important to current practice. The discussion can include other findings, but the EPC need not discuss every finding.
 
When discussing findings in relation to what was already known, avoid detailing differences with existing reviews, particularly when prior reviews are out of date, of different scope, or otherwise not comparable. If some results could be controversial, provide justification for accepting the new findings over the conclusions of past reports. If the review is an update, discuss how the new findings compare with the previous review.6 

[DZ32]As required under PRISMA, the Discussion Chapter should also discuss the implications of the report's findings with regard to current clinical practice patterns, guidelines, educational programs, or health care policies (directly related to the decisional dilemmas outlined in the Background Chapter). Subheadings can be used (e.g., Considerations for Clinical Practice and Policy). 

[DZ33]Assess the strengths and limitations of both the evidence (including evidence gaps) and the review; use appropriate headings/subheadings if they would improve readability (e.g., Strengths of the Review, Limitations of the Review Process, and Limitations of the Evidence Base). Summarize the limitations of the evidence (consider evidence gaps and the implications for future research) and the principal methodologic problems (e.g., narrow population or settings, limitations in comparisons or outcomes) with the bodies of evidence amassed for the review. Include any problems encountered in conducting the systematic review, how the EPC addressed them, and how they may have influenced the review. Highlighting strengths as well as weaknesses is appropriate, recognizing that decisions often need to be made with limited evidence. There is no need to repeat any topic covered in detail earlier in this Discussion Chapter.
