Activity variables had greatest impact. |
| Executive Function Measures in Adults with ADHD | Lovejoy et al. | 1999 | Adults with and without ADHD | Not clearly specified in extract | • Executive function measures (multiple)<br>• Battery approach | Battery approach hypothesized to increase ability to detect ADHD. Study supported the role of executive function deficits in adult ADHD. |
