# **Summary** of Adult ADHD Performance Validity/Effort Testing Studies

This table summarizes research studies examining performance validity tests (PVTs) and symptom validity measures for adult ADHD assessment. These measures are designed to identify cognitive and behavioral symptom exaggeration or noncredible performance during ADHD evaluations.

- TOVA: Test of Variables of Attention
- CAT-A: Clinical Assessment of Attention Deficit-Adult
- CVLT-II: California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition
- WMT: Word Memory Test
- CAARS: Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales
- EVIs: Embedded Validity Indicators
- NPV: Negative Predictive Value
- PPV: Positive Predictive Value
- MMPI-2-RF: Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form

## Key Findings:

1. The Word Memory Test (WMT) and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) show good sensitivity (54-64%) and excellent specificity (90-95%) for detecting invalid performance in adult ADHD evaluations.
2. The ADHD Symptom Infrequency Scale (ASIS) shows promising results as a dedicated measure for detecting feigned ADHD symptoms with high sensitivity (79-86%) and specificity (89%).
3. Combining multiple embedded validity indicators significantly improves detection accuracy compared to using individual measures.
4. Tests focusing on attention, vigilance, and inhibition appear most effective for detecting noncredible performance in ADHD assessments.
5. Estimated base rates of noncredible performance in adult ADHD evaluations range from approximately 15-30%, with Marshall et al. (2010) finding 22% of patients engaged in symptom exaggeration.
