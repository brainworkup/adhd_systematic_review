DCT performance was assessed among 210 consecutive adult ADHD referrals who underwent neuropsychological evaluation and were classified into valid (n = 175) or invalid (n = 35) groups based on seven independent criterion PVTs. The invalid group had significantly worse DCT performance than the valid group using both the standard and unrounded scoring procedure (\u03b7p2 =\u00a0.28). Classification accuracy was excellent, with 54.3% sensitivity\/92% specificity at optimal cut-scores of \u226514 (rounded) and \u226513.38 (unrounded). Nonsignificant DCT performance differences emerged based on ADHD subtype or the presence\/absence of comorbid psychopathology. The DCT functions well as a nonmemory-based PVT in an ethnoracially diverse ADHD population, supporting its clinical utility for detecting invalid neurocognitive performance during ADHD evaluations.","tags":{"Accession Number":"34643101","Author Address":"University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, USA.

The purpose of this study was to develop new validity indicators specific to feigned ADHD for the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and compare them to preexisting imbedded PAI validity measures. METHOD: PAI scales that were theoretically related to feigned ADHD were evaluated. A binomial (ADHD simulators, n = 138, and genuine ADHD, n = 142) logistic regression was conducted with selected PAI scales and subscales. Classification rates were compared between the new and existing validity scales. A similar approach was used for item-level data in a second study in a subgroup of the original sample. RESULTS: The derived PAI scale-based logistic regression had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 92%. This algorithm accurately identified 97% of healthy controls as not feigning ADHD and correctly identified 98% of a no diagnosis group and 75% of a mood\/anxiety disorders group. Classification accuracy of the new index was superior to the majority of existing PAI validity scales across groups. An item-level PAI algorithm had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97% for identifying feigned ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: New validity measures were compared to existing PAI validity indicators and performed better than many of them in this study. The algorithms developed in this study of ADHD simulators and genuine ADHD cases have adequate sensitivity and good specificity and appear to function differently than other PAI symptom validity scales.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29186287","Author Address":"Psychology Department, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.

In this study, we compared a large single diagnosis group of patients with ADHD (combined, inattentive, and hyperactive) to healthy controls using brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to determine specific brain regions which could serve as potential biomarkers to reliably distinguish ADHD. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, subjects (n = 1,135) were obtained from a large multisite psychiatric database, where resting state (baseline) and on-task SPECT scans were obtained. Only baseline scans were analyzed in the present study. Subjects were separated into two groups - Group 1 (n = 1,006) was composed of patients who only met criteria for ADHD with no comorbid diagnoses, while a control group (n = 129) composed of individuals who did not meet criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis, brain injury, or substance use served as a non-matched control. SPECT regions of interests (ROIs) and visual readings were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Predicted probabilities from this analysis were inputted into a Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis to identify sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: The baseline ROIs and visual readings show significant separations from healthy controls. Sensitivity of the visual reads was 100% while specificity was >97%. The sensitivity and specificity of the post-hoc ROI analysis were both 100%. Decreased perfusion was primarily seen in the orbitofrontal cortices, anterior cingulate gyri, areas of the prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes. In addition, ROI analysis revealed some unexpected areas with predictive value in distinguishing ADHD, such as cerebellar subregions and portions of the temporal lobes. Conclusions: Brain perfusion SPECT distinguishes adult ADHD patients without comorbidities from healthy controls. Areas which were highly significantly different from control and thus may serve as biomarkers in baseline SPECT scans included: medial anterior prefrontal cortex, left anterior temporal lobe, and right insular cortex. Future studies of these potential biomarkers in ADHD patients with comorbidities are warranted.","tags":{"Accession Number":"34899414","Author Address":"Amen Clinics, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA, United States.

A specific screening tool, such as the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self Report Scale Screener can be the first step in identifying the condition. Recently, the screener has been revised because the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition, made some changes to the criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. This study compared the screeners based upon the Fourth and Fifth edition of the Manual. One hundred and forty patients, including seventy with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, completed both screeners, independent from a clinical diagnostic interview. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated based on four different scoring methods: a categorical score of three or four positive answers, and a dimensional score of twelve or fourteen. Both screening instruments appeared to perform equally without significant differences between them, no matter which scoring system was used. However, the only satisfactory result was obtained using the dimensional scoring with a cutoff of 12, providing a sensitivity and negative predictive value above 80%. This is a lower cut off than recommended in community and clinic samples. It is possible that the cut off of the screener may need to be adjusted depending on the circumstances within which it is used.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29270886","Author Address":"Renewal Treatment Inc, 700 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15219, USA. lbastiaens@RenewalInc.com.

By administering a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery to 57 adults with ADHD, 60 neurotypical controls, and 151 instructed simulators, we examined each test's utility in detecting noncredible performance. Cut-off scores were derived for all available outcome variables. Although all ensured at least 90% specificity in the ADHD Group, sensitivity differed significantly between tests, ranging from 0% to 64.9%. Tests of selective attention, vigilance, and inhibition were most useful in detecting the instructed simulation of adult ADHD, whereas figural fluency and task switching lacked sensitivity. Five or more test variables demonstrating results in the second to fourth percentile were rare among cases of genuine adult ADHD but identified approximately 58% of instructed simulators.","tags":{"Accession Number":"36901080","Author Address":"Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen, 9712 TS Groningen, The Netherlands.

Method: The study had two phases. First, using a prospective design, healthy adults who simulated ADHD were compared with healthy controls and ADHD patients who performed the tasks to the best of their ability (n = 47 per group). Participants performed the MOXO-d-CPT and an established performance validity test (PVT). Second, the MOXO-d-CPT classification accuracy, employed in Phase 1, was retrospectively compared with archival data of 47 ADHD patients and age-matched healthy controls. Results: Simulators performed significantly worse on all MOXO-d-CPT indices than healthy controls and ADHD patients. Three MOXO-d-CPT indices (attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) and a scale combining these indices showed adequate discriminative capacity. Conclusion: The MOXO-d-CPT showed promise for the detection of feigned ADHD and, pending replication, can be employed for this aim in clinical practice and ADHD research.","tags":{"Accession Number":"31364437","Author Address":"Ariel University, Ariel, Israel.

In this study we examined the diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a larger population of adults with and without ADHD. METHOD: Subjects were unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a response inhibition task (Go\/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed into a machine learning algorithm. RESULTS: The BNA analysis of the EEG data recorded during the Go\/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for the NoGo condition). CONCLUSIONS: BNA methodology can help differentiate between ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective evaluation of electrophysiological changes associated with ADHD. Results also support a network-based approach to the study of ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"28065167","Author Address":"Massachusettes General Hospital,Boston,MA,USA.

Neuropsychological tests like continuous performance tests (CPT) try to solve this dilemma by objectively measurable parameters. We investigated in a cohort of n=114 patients presenting to an ADHD outpatient clinic how well a commercially available CPT test (QbTest(\u00ae)) can differentiate between patients with ADHD (n=94) and patients with a disconfirmed ADHD diagnosis (n=20). Both groups showed numerous comorbidities, predominantly depression (27.2% in the ADHD group vs. 45% in the non-ADHD group) and substance-use disorders (18.1% vs. 10%, respectively). Patients with ADHD showed significant higher activity (2.07 \u00b1 1.23) than patients without ADHD (1.34 \u00b1 1.27, dF=112; p=0.019), whereas for the other core parameters, inattention and impulsivity no differences could be found. Reaction time variability has been discussed as a typical marker for inattention in ADHD. Therefore, we investigated how well ex-Gaussian analysis of response time can differentiate between ADHD and other patients, showing, that it does not help to identify patients with ADHD. Even though patients with ADHD showed significantly higher activity, this parameter differed only poorly between patients (accuracy AUC 65% of an ROC-Curve). We conclude that CPTs do not help to identify patients with ADHD in a specialized outpatient clinic. The usability of this test for differentiating between ADHD and other psychiatric disorders is poor and a sophisticated analysis of reaction time did not decisively increase the test accuracy.","tags":{"Accession Number":"32265761","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

We searched for a neuroanatomical signature associated with ADHD spectrum symptoms in adults by applying, for the first time, machine learning-based pattern classification methods to structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from stimulant-na\u00efve adults with childhood-onset ADHD and healthy controls (HC). METHOD: Sixty-seven ADHD patients and 66 HC underwent high-resolution T1-weighted and DTI acquisitions. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a non-linear kernel was applied on multimodal image features extracted on regions of interest placed across the whole brain. RESULTS: The discrimination between a mixed-gender ADHD subgroup and individually matched HC (n = 58 each) yielded area-under-the-curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy (DA) values of up to 0.71% and 66% (P = 0.003) respectively. AUC and DA values increased to 0.74% and 74% (P = 0.0001) when analyses were restricted to males (52 ADHD vs. 44 HC). CONCLUSION: Although not at the level of clinically definitive DA, the neuroanatomical signature identified herein may provide additional, objective information that could influence treatment decisions in adults with ADHD spectrum symptoms.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29080396","Author Address":"Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroimaging (LIM-21), Department and Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

METHOD: Flicker task and CCPT performance were compared between an ADHD (n = 28) and control (n = 30) group of college students. RESULTS: This study replicated previous flicker task findings, providing support for using the flicker task to demonstrate the robust nature of change blindness. However, the flicker task did not demonstrate better discriminative utility than the CCPT. Task-dependent measures correlated with ADHD rating scale indices of inattention and hyperactivity\/impulsivity, indicating that CPTs lack symptom domain specificity. CONCLUSION: Results support the growing evidence that CPTs currently provide only modest utility for discriminating performance in adults with and without ADHD.

While most studies have focused on detection of non-credible performance using performance validity tests, there are few studies examining the ability to detect non-credible report of ADHD symptoms. We provide further validation data for a recently developed measure of non-credible ADHD symptom report, the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) Infrequency Index (CII). METHOD: Using archival data from 86 adults referred for concerns about ADHD, we examined the accuracy of the CII in detecting extreme scores on the CAARS and invalid reporting on validity indices of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Format (MMPI-2-RF). We also examined the accuracy of the CII in detecting non-credible performance on standalone and embedded performance validity tests. RESULTS: The CII was 52% sensitive to extreme scores on CAARS DSM symptom subscales (with 97% specificity) and 20%-36% sensitive to invalid responding on MMPI-2-RF validity scales (with near 90% specificity), providing further evidence for the interpretation of the CII as an indicator of non-credible ADHD symptom report. However, the CII detected only 18% of individuals who failed a standalone performance validity test (Word Memory Test), with 87.8% specificity, and was not accurate in detecting non-credible performance using embedded digit span cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should continue to examine how best to assess for non-credible symptom report in ADHD referrals.","tags":{"Accession Number":"27193367","Author Address":"Department of Psychology, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.

Over the course of 3 studies, valid data was collected from 402 participants assigned to control, simulator, ADHD diagnosed, or possible undiagnosed ADHD groups. Group assignment was based on self-reported history of ADHD diagnosis including information about the credentials of diagnosing professional and methods used. The ASIS includes an Infrequency Scale (INF) designed to detect rarely reported symptoms of ADHD and several clinical scales designed to measure genuine symptoms. The final version of the ASIS demonstrated high internal consistency for the INF (\u03b1 = .96) and the ADHD Total scales (\u03b1= .96). Convergent validity for the ADHD Total was established through a strong correlation with Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (r = .92). Initial validation of the INF yielded high discriminability between groups (d = 2.76; 95% confidence interval [2.17, 3.36]). The final INF scale demonstrated strong sensitivity (.79-.86) and excellent specificity (.89). Using our study's malingering base rate of 29%, positive and negative predictive values were strong (.71-.79 and .92-.93, respectively). Additional information is provided for a range of base rates. Current results suggest that the ASIS has potential as a reliable and valid measure of ADHD that is sensitive to malingering when compared to a sample of individuals self-reporting a history of ADHD diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 3 commonly used ADHD screening instruments in cocaine-dependent individuals. METHOD: Adults seeking treatment for cocaine dependence (N = 102) were administered 3 self-report instruments between May 2009 and April 2011: the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS), the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 (ASRS-V1.1). They then met with master's-level clinicians who administered the Conners Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID). With the CAADID serving as the gold standard, the validity of the screening instruments was determined, both singly and in combination. RESULTS: Twenty-five (25%) of the 102 patients met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD or ADHD not otherwise specified (NOS) based on the CAADID. Kappa scores determining agreement between the screening tools and the CAADID (with ADHD NOS labeled as ADHD or labeled as not ADHD) ranged from 0.37 to 0.69. Sensitivity scores for the broadest range of ADHD cases were 80.0%, 87.5%, and 60.9% for the CAARS, WURS, and ASRS-V1.1, respectively. Positive predictive value was highest for the CAARS, at 74.1%, and negative predictive value was highest for the WURS, at 95.1%. The highest sensitivity (96.0%) was found with coadministration of the WURS and CAARS. CONCLUSION: While all of the screening instruments were found to have adequate sensitivity and specificity, the CAARS outperformed the other instruments in regard to agreement with the CAADID and positive predictive values. However, the WURS, with the highest sensitivity in regard to the broadest range of ADHD cases, may be the single best instrument for preliminary screening purposes. Further, because the ASRS-V1.1 is the simplest and shortest instrument to administer, it may have advantages when a large number of patients need to be screened.","tags":{"Accession Number":"23218166","Author Address":"New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, 1051 Riverside Dr, Unit 66, New York, NY 10032, USA. dakware@nyspi.columbia.edu","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Nov","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:24","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:24","DOI":"10.4088\/JCP.12m07895","Epub Date":"2012\/12\/12","ISSN":"0160-6689 (Print) 0160-6689","Issue":"11","Journal":"J Clin Psychiatry","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/*epidemiology\/rehabilitation Cocaine-Related Disorders\/*diagnosis\/*epidemiology\/rehabilitation Comorbidity Depressive Disorder, Major\/diagnosis\/epidemiology\/rehabilitation Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Female Humans *Interview, Psychological Male Mass Screening\/*statistics & numerical data Personality Inventory\/*statistics & numerical data Psychometrics\/statistics & numerical data Reproducibility of Results Retinitis Pigmentosa","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","NIHMSID":"NIHMS455145 and has received medication from US World Meds for a National Institutes of Health\u2013funded study.

ADHD is an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior and contributes to many aspects of impaired function in adults. Diagnosis of ADHD in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients is challenging due to the overlap in cognitive symptoms between the two disorders. The ADHD Self-Report Scale, version 1.1 (ASRS-v1.1) is a widely used screening instrument for ADHD in adults but its accuracy has not been evaluated previously in treatment-seeking MDD patients. We administered the ASRS-v1.1 to 55 healthy controls and 40 adults with a primary psychiatric diagnosis of MDD who were participating in clinical research studies. ADHD diagnosis was assessed via structured interview with the adult ADHD module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus version 6.0.0 (MINI) along with a psychiatrist's assessment. Overall, full-syndrome ADHD was diagnosed in 12.5% of the MDD patients. MDD patients endorsed all 18 items of the ASRS-v1.1 more frequently than the healthy controls and the number of ASRS-v1.1 items endorsed correlated with levels of anxiety in the MDD patients. The ASRS-v1.1 demonstrated fair performance for identifying full syndrome DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis, with sensitivity 60%, specificity: 68.6%, positive predictive value 21.4%, negative predictive value 92.3% and total classification accuracy of 67.5%. Positive predictive value improved substantially when the ADHD criterion requiring symptom onset before age 7 was omitted. In adult MDD patients, a negative ASRS-v1.1 screen strongly suggests the absence of ADHD but positive screen results require careful evaluation to determine whether self-reported ADHD symptoms simply emerge from depression or whether comorbid ADHD is present.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29596328","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Emory University, 12 Executive Park Drive, 3rd Floor, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. bdunlop@emory.edu.

The instruments were examined in ADHD versus a clinical group with overlapping symptoms including borderline personality disorder and bipolar II disorder, and another clinical group with participants assessed for but disconfirmed a diagnosis of ADHD as well as adult normative participants. METHODS: The Quantified Behavior Test Plus includes Continuous Performance Testing and a Motion Tracking System with parameters related to attention and activity operationalized as the cardinal symptoms of ADHD and then summarized into a Weighed Core Symptoms scale with ten cut-points ranging from 0 to 100. A categorical predictor variable called Prediction of ADHD was used to examine the levels of sensitivity and specificity for the Quantified Behavior Test Plus with regard to ADHD. RESULTS: The Weighed Core Symptoms scale separated ADHD and normative participants from each other as well as from the two clinical reference groups. The scale reported highest levels of core symptoms in the ADHD group and the lowest level of core symptoms in the normative group. Analyses with Prediction of ADHD yielded 85 % specificity for the normative group, 87 % sensitivity for the ADHD group, 36 % sensitivity for the bipolar II and borderline group and 41 % sensitivity for the group with a disconfirmed diagnosis of ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The Weighed Core Symptoms scale facilitated objective assessment of adult ADHD insofar that the ADHD group presented more core symptoms than the other two clinical groups and the normative group. Sensitivity for the Quantified Behavior Test Plus was lower in complex clinical groups with Bipolar II disorder, Borderline disorder and in patients with a disconfirmed diagnosis of ADHD. The psychometric instruments may be further evaluated with regard to well-documented and effective treatment programs for ADHD core symptoms.","tags":{"Accession Number":"23166565","Author Address":"Department of Psychology, Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden.","Database Provider":"NLM","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:25","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:25","DOI":"10.2174\/1745017901208010134","Epub Date":"2012\/11\/21","ISSN":"1745-0179","Journal":"Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health","Keywords":"Adults Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Behavior Hyperactivity Objective measures Psychometrics Quantified Behavior Test Plus.","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1745-0179 Edebol, Hanna Helldin, Lars Norlander, Torsten Journal Article United Arab Emirates Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health. 2012;8:134-43. doi: 10.2174\/1745017901208010134.

Scale performance was assessed in a clinical study including 100 ADHD patients and 65 opiate-dependent patient controls, and in the Zurich study, an epidemiological age cohort followed over 30\u00a0years of adult life. Assessments included a ROC analysis of sensitivity and specificity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, external validity and measurement invariance over nine testing occasions. The new scale showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 54%, respectively, internal consistency over 0.8 (McDonald's omega, Cronbach's alpha), one-year test-retest reliabilities over 0.7, statistically significant and substantial correlations with two other validated self-rating scales of adult ADHD (R\u00a0=\u00a00.5 and 0.66, respectively), and an acceptable degree of longitudinal stability (i.e., measurement invariance). The proposed scale must be further evaluated, but these preliminary results indicate it could be a useful rating instrument for adult ADHD in situations where SCL-90-R data, but no specific ADHD assessment, are available, such as in retrospective data analysis or in prospective studies with limited methodical resources.","tags":{"Accession Number":"22212725","Author Address":"Zurich University Psychiatric Hospital, Lenggstr. 31, 8032, Zurich, Switzerland. dominique.eich@puk.zh.ch","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Sep","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:25","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:25","DOI":"10.1007\/s00406-011-0288-1","Epub Date":"2012\/01\/04","ISSN":"0940-1334","Issue":"6","Journal":"Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/classification\/*diagnosis\/psychology Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Opioid-Related Disorders\/psychology *Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychometrics\/*instrumentation Reproducibility of Results *Self-Assessment Sensitivity and Specificity Surveys and Questionnaires","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1433-8491 Eich, Dominique Angst, Jules Frei, Anja Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta R\u00f6ssler, Wulf Gamma, Alex Evaluation Study Journal Article Multicenter Study Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Germany Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2012 Sep;262(6):519-28. doi: 10.1007\/s00406-011-0288-1.

Applying subjective measures always incorporates risks such as informant biases or large differences between ratings obtained from diverse sources. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ratings and tests seem to assess somewhat different constructs. The use of objective measures might thus yield valuable information for diagnosing ADHD. This study aims at evaluating the role of objective measures when trying to distinguish between individuals with ADHD and controls. Our sample consisted of children (n\u2009=\u200960) and adults (n\u2009=\u200976) diagnosed with ADHD and matched controls who completed self- and observer ratings as well as objective tasks. Diagnosis was primarily based on clinical interviews. A popular pattern recognition approach, support vector machines, was used to predict the diagnosis. RESULTS: We observed relatively high accuracy of 79% (adults) and 78% (children) applying solely objective measures. Predicting an ADHD diagnosis using both subjective and objective measures exceeded the accuracy of objective measures for both adults (89.5%) and children (86.7%), with the subjective variables proving to be the most relevant. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that objective measures are more robust against rater bias and errors inherent in subjective measures and may be more replicable. Considering the high accuracy of objective measures only, we found in our study, we think that they should be incorporated in diagnostic procedures for assessing ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29776429","Author Address":"Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, Department of Psychology, Philipps University Marburg, Gutenbergstr. 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany.

Participants were categorized into invalid and valid performance groups as determined by scores from empirical performance validity indicators. Analyses revealed that all of the EVIs could meaningfully discriminate invalid from valid performers (AUCs = .69-.78), with high specificity (\u226590%) but low sensitivity (19%-51%). However, none of them explained more than 20% of the variance in validity status. Combining any of these 10 EVIs into a multivariate model significantly improved classification accuracy, explaining up to 36% of the variance in validity status. Integrating six EVIs from the Stroop Color and Word Test, Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition was as efficacious (AUC = .86) as using all 10 EVIs together. Failing any two of these six EVIs or any three of the 10 EVIs yielded clinically acceptable specificity (\u226590%) with moderate sensitivity (60%). Findings support the use of multivariate models to improve the identification of performance invalidity in ADHD evaluations, but chaining multiple EVIs may only be helpful to an extent.","tags":{"Accession Number":"37703401","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School, Chicago, IL, USA.

The current study sought to determine whether ex-Gaussian parameters of simple reaction time are better able to discriminate between children and adults with and without ADHD, compared with traditional measures of inhibitory control. METHODS: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to examine the ability of performance on two commonly used tasks of inhibitory control (i.e. stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and go-no-go tasks) to predict ADHD status in preschool (N = 108), middle childhood (N = 309), and young adulthood (N = 133). RESULTS: Across all samples, SSRT, go-no-go percentage of failed inhibits, and standard deviation of reaction (SDRT) time to \"go\" trials, all successfully discriminated between individuals with and without ADHD. Ex-Gaussian decomposition of the RT distribution indicated that both larger tau and larger sigma drove findings for SDRT. Contrary to predictions, traditional measures of inhibitory control were equal if not better predictors of ADHD status than ex-Gaussian parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support ongoing work to quantify the separate contributions of cognitive subprocesses that drive task performance, which in turn is critical to developing and improving process-based approaches in clinical assessment.","tags":{"Accession Number":"34488917","Author Address":"Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.

Many items reflect emotional dysregulation. Although over 30 publications have examined its psychometric properties, reliance on non-clinical samples has limited conclusions from these reports, as have sub-optimal statistical approaches in most previous publications. None compared the full WURS to the abbreviated WURS-25. We evaluated both versions with adults presenting for treatment: 137 with ADHD and 230 with GAD or MDD, along with 120 normal controls. Factor analysis was performed on the full WURS using the clinical cohorts. The WURS versions were compared using ANOVA, logistic regression, ROC and confusion matrices. Consistent with two previous reports, the full WURS generated five factors: Disruptive mood & behavior, ADHD, Anxiety\/dysphoria, Social and Academic. The ADHD factor correlated r\u00a0>\u00a00.8 with the Disruptive mood\/behavior and the Academic factor. ADHD patients scored higher than GAD\/MDD subjects (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) on the Disruptive mood & behavior, ADHD, and Academic factors. The WURS-25 produced good separation of ADHD subjects from normal controls with ROC (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.974) and logistic regression (Sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a091%, Specificity\u00a0=\u00a092%). Conversely, the full WURS better separated ADHD subjects from psychiatric controls with both ROC (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.995) and logistic regression (Sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a084%, Specificity\u00a0=\u00a094%). Use of the full WURS with its five factors proved more successful at distinguishing ADHD from MDD and GAD than did the WURS-25. Its factors identify symptoms, including those of emotional dysregulation, critical to understanding ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"33493947","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used to assess differences in rating scale scores between clinical (n\u00a0=\u00a052) and control (n\u00a0=\u00a074) samples as well as differences among subgroups of the clinical sample (22 ADHD; 16 ADHD\u00a0+\u00a0ANX; 14 ANX). METHOD: Participants completed an online questionnaire where they responded to the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS; Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, ) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory scales (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, ). RESULTS: Results showed that the CAARS and STAI had limited sensitivity and specificity and may lack in ability to differentially diagnose ADHD and\/or ANX. Cluster analysis was used to guide the proposal of modifications for the two scales, which were to use inattentive items only for the CAARS and to exclude state ANX-present items on the STAI for use in differential diagnosis. Further parametric analysis supported these proposed modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be made aware of the limitations of the CAARS and STAI scales in terms of specificity, when used to inform differential diagnosis of ADHD and ANX. Further analysis on the psychometric properties of these modified scales is needed in order to confirm that they are valid and reliable scales. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Clinical implications It is possible that widely used self-report rating scales are not valid for use in the context of assessing adult ADHD when ANX is present. Clinicians should take alternative approaches to measuring ADHD symptoms in the context of ANX. Findings of the present study suggest the use of inattentive items only for the CAARS and to exclude state ANX-present items on the STAI for differential diagnostic use. Limitations of the study The sample sizes of the clinical subgroups were relatively small. Diagnoses were not confirmed using a semi-structured clinical interview. Alternative cluster approaches (e.g., two-step clustering using larger samples) would provide further insight.","tags":{"Accession Number":"28895146","Author Address":"School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Ireland.

This study evaluated the incremental validity of adding an objective measure of activity and computerised cognitive assessment to clinical rating scales to differentiate adult ADHD from Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Adults with ADHD (n=33) or ASD (n=25) performed the QbTest, comprising a Continuous Performance Test with motion-tracker to record physical activity. QbTest parameters measuring inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity were combined to provide a summary score ('QbTotal'). Binary stepwise logistic regression measured the probability of assignment to the ADHD or ASD group based on scores on the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale-subscale E (CAARS-E) and Autism Quotient (AQ10) in the first step and then QbTotal added in the second step. The model fit was significant at step 1 (CAARS-E, AQ10) with good group classification accuracy. These predictors were retained and QbTotal was added, resulting in a significant improvement in model fit and group classification accuracy. All predictors were significant. ROC curves indicated superior specificity of QbTotal. The findings present preliminary evidence that adding QbTest to clinical rating scales may improve the differentiation of ADHD and ASD in adults.","tags":{"Accession Number":"27400220","Author Address":"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Triumph Road, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK.

ADHD is a multifactorial disorder in which many genes, all with small effects, are thought to cause the disorder in the presence of unfavourable environmental conditions. Therefore, in this pilot study, we explored the expression profile of a list of previously established candidate genes in peripheral blood samples from adult ADHD subjects (n = 108) and compared these results with those of healthy controls (n = 35). We demonstrate that combining the gene expression levels of dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), dopamine D5 receptor, tryptophan hydroxylase-1, and SNAP25 as predictors in a regression model resulted in sensitivity and specificity of over 80 % (ROC: max R(2) = 0.587, AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001, 95 % CI: 0.900-0.985). In conclusion, the combination of these four genes could represent a potential method for estimating risk and could be of diagnostic value for ADHD. Nevertheless, further investigation in a larger independent population including different subtypes of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive, or combined type) patients is required to obtain more specific sets of biomarkers for each subtype as well as to differentiate between child, adolescent, and adulthood forms.","tags":{"Accession Number":"22562805","Author Address":"Hospital of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Zurich, Neum\u00fcensterallee 9, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland. edna.gruenblatt@kjpdzh.ch","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jun","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:27","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:27","DOI":"10.1007\/s12402-012-0074-6","Epub Date":"2012\/05\/09","ISSN":"1866-6116","Issue":"2","Journal":"Atten Defic Hyperact Disord","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*blood\/*genetics Biomarkers\/*blood Case-Control Studies Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins\/*blood Female Gene Expression Profiling\/methods Genetic Association Studies\/*methods Genetic Predisposition to Disease\/genetics Genotype Humans Male Pilot Projects Receptors, Dopamine D5\/*blood Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25\/*blood Tryptophan Hydroxylase\/*blood","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1866-6647 Gr\u00fcnblatt, Edna Geissler, Julia Jacob, Christian P Renner, Tobias M\u00fcller, Maja Bartl, Jasmin Gross-Lesch, Silke Riederer, Peter Lesch, Klaus-Peter Walitza, Susanne Gerlach, Manfred Schmitt, Angelika Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Austria Atten Defic Hyperact Disord. 2012 Jun;4(2):77-84. doi: 10.1007\/s12402-012-0074-6.

METHODS: 54 healthy and 57 ADHD adults participated in the study. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right prefrontal cortex and also recorded during the Stop Signal task. RESULTS: TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) and the event related potential (ERP) components in the Stop Signal task were found to be significantly reduced in ADHD relative to the matched healthy controls. Stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and stopping accuracy was found to correlate with the ERP signal, and ADHD severity correlated with the TEP signal. Cortical activity (early TEP and Stop Signal ERP) diagnostic model yielded accuracy of 72%. CONCLUSION: TEPs and ERPs reveal that right PFC excitability was associated with ADHD severity, and with behavioral impulsivity - as a hallmark of ADHD pathology. This electrophysiological biomarker supports the potential of objective diagnosis for ADHD. SIGNIFICANCE: Such tools would allow better assessment of treatment efficacy and prognosis, may advance understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and better the public's attitudes and stigma towards ADHD.

This article describes the development and initial validation of a new symptom validity measure designed to detect feigned or exaggerated ADHD symptom reporting. METHOD: Employing items from a commonly used self-report measure of ADHD (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale [CAARS]) and select items from a scale measuring symptoms of dissociation, we assessed students diagnosed with ADHD, students with other diagnoses, and student volunteers with no psychopathology. RESULTS: This new measure (Exaggeration Index or EI) demonstrated excellent specificity (.97) and adequate sensitivity (.24) in discriminating between those who are suspected of or instructed to feign or exaggerate symptoms of ADHD and all other clinical groups. CONCLUSION: The results strongly suggest that the EI may be a useful adjunct to existing validity measures when identifying exaggerated or implausible symptoms of ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"26954905","Author Address":"a Regional Assessment & Resource Centre , Queen's University , Kingston , Canada.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Feb","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:28","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:28","DOI":"10.1080\/13854046.2016.1154188","Epub Date":"2016\/03\/10","ISSN":"1385-4046","Issue":"2","Journal":"Clin Neuropsychol","Keywords":"Adolescent Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/*psychology *Deception Female Healthy Volunteers Humans Male Middle Aged *Neuropsychological Tests Reading Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Students Young Adult Adhd assessment exaggeration validity testing","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1744-4144 Harrison, Allyson G Armstrong, Irene T Journal Article Validation Study England Clin Neuropsychol. 2016 Feb;30(2):265-83. doi: 10.1080\/13854046.2016.1154188.

While the field of neuropsychology has identified that factors, such as effort and motivation, can significantly interfere with correct interpretation of self-reported symptoms and test scores, evaluation methods for other psychological conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have not addressed effort and motivation as potential factors influencing accurate diagnosis. In analyzing the performance of students simulating ADHD, and comparing it to performance of both non-ADHD and genuine ADHD students, this study clearly demonstrated that the symptoms of ADHD are easily fabricated, and that simulators would be indistinguishable from those with true ADHD. In addition, students motivated to feign ADHD could easily perform poorly on tests of reading and processing speed, thus allowing them access to academic accommodations.

Despite this, almost no methods exist to assist clinicians in identifying when such behavior occurs. Recently, new validity indicators specific to feigned ADHD were reported for the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Derived from a logistic regression, these algorithms are said to have excellent specificity and good sensitivity in identifying feigned ADHD. However, these authors compared those with genuine ADHD only to nonclinical undergraduate students (asked to respond honestly or asked to simulate ADHD); no criterion group of definite malingerers was included. We therefore investigated these new validity indicators with 331 postsecondary students who underwent assessment for possible ADHD and compared scores of those who were eventually diagnosed with ADHD (n\u2009=\u2009111) to those who were not [Clinical controls (66), Definite malingerers (36); No diagnosis (117)]. The two proposed PAI algorithms were found to have poor positive predictive value (.19 and .17). Self-report validity measures from the Connors' Adult Attention Rating Scale, and the Negative Impression Management scale on the PAI returned more positive results. Overall, more research is needed to better identify noncredible ADHD presentation, as the PAI-based methods proposed by Aita et\u00a0al. appear inadequate as symptom validity measures.","tags":{"Accession Number":"31852281","Author Address":"Department of Psychology, Queen's University (Regional Assessment and Resource Centre), Kingston, Canada.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jan-Feb","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:28","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:28","DOI":"10.1080\/23279095.2019.1702043","Epub Date":"2019\/12\/20","ISSN":"2327-9095","Issue":"1","Journal":"Appl Neuropsychol Adult","Keywords":"Adult *Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/diagnosis Humans Malingering\/diagnosis Personality Assessment Personality Inventory Reproducibility of Results Students Adhd Symptom Validity Testing non-credible performance","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"2327-9109 Harrison, Allyson G Harrison, Kathleen A Armstrong, Irene T Journal Article United States Appl Neuropsychol Adult. 2022 Jan-Feb;29(1):10-22. doi: 10.1080\/23279095.2019.1702043.

Method: This present study investigated the ability of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) to discriminate between 249 postsecondary students with carefully diagnosed ADHD and 507 clinical controls. Results: The overall discriminant validity of the CAARS was 69%, and it had an unacceptably high false positive and false negative rate. At lower prevalence rates, a high score on the CAARS has only a 22% chance of accurately identifying individuals with ADHD.

METHODS: Primary care patients were evaluated during routine clinic visits with a self-report screening tool comprised of 85 DSM-IV symptom-based candidate questions. Patients with a physician-assessed provisional diagnosis for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive episode (MDE), past\/present mania, and adult attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or none of these, completed additional self-report clinical questionnaires, and then were interviewed on the telephone by a trained rater for a SCID\/ACDS diagnosis. Responses to the symptom-based candidate questions were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity for a SCID\/ACDS diagnosis (GAD, N = 24; MDE, N = 89; Mania, N = 24; ADHD, N = 65) and to select the optimal four questions for each diagnosis to be included in the instrument. RESULTS: Analyses resulted in a 17-item instrument for provisional differential diagnosis of GAD, MDE, past\/present mania, and ADHD. Comparison of limited symptom-based versus full DSM-IV criteria-based diagnosis showed minimal differences for relative diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivities and specificities, respectively, were 83% and 75% for GAD, 80% and 80% for MDE, 83% and 82% for mania, and 82%and 73% for ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this preliminary work, the Provisional Diagnostic Instrument-4 is a brief, easily scored, self-report instrument that may assist primary care physicians to identify potential cases of GAD, MDE, past\/present mania, and ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"21300195","Author Address":"Lilly USA, LLC, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA. hourstonjp@lilly.com","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jan-Feb","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:28","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:28","DOI":"10.1016\/j.psym.2010.11.011","Epub Date":"2011\/02\/09","ISSN":"0033-3182","Issue":"1","Journal":"Psychosomatics","Keywords":"Anxiety Disorders\/diagnosis\/psychology Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/diagnosis\/psychology Bipolar Disorder\/diagnosis\/psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Depressive Disorder, Major\/diagnosis\/psychology Female Humans Interviews as Topic Male Mass Screening\/*instrumentation\/methods Mental Disorders\/*diagnosis\/psychology Middle Aged Primary Health Care\/*methods Reproducibility of Results *Self Report Sensitivity and Specificity *Surveys and Questionnaires United States","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1545-7206 Houston, John P Kroenke, Kurt Faries, Douglas E Doebbeling, Caroline Carney Adler, Lenard A Ahl, Jonna Swindle, Ralph Trzepacz, Paula T Evaluation Study Journal Article Multicenter Study Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England Psychosomatics. 2011 Jan-Feb;52(1):48-55. doi: 10.1016\/j.psym.2010.11.011.","Pages":"48-55","Short Title":"A provisional screening instrument for four common mental disorders in adult primary care patients","Type":"JOUR","Volume":"52","Year":"2011"},"attachments":["390_Houston 2011.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"14592":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer1","key":"","data":[{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"KQ1"}},{"question":"ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Houston, 2011{#390}"}},{"question":"trial_ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ID N\/A"}},{"question":"location","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"US"}},{"question":"sites","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"21","answer":"Multicenter"}},{"question":"funding","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"Lilly USA, LLC\u200b","answer":"Industry"}},{"question":"setting","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"Primary Care Centers","answer":"Primary Care"}},{"question":"size","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"343"}},{"question":"ADHDsample","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Adults at least 18 years old, nonpsychotic, presenting to primary care"}},{"question":"participants_other","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Adults from primary care who did not meet ADHD diagnostic criteria"}},{"question":"other_participant_category","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"Clinical"}},{"question":"percent_female","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"60"}},{"question":"age_mean_SD","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"50 (N\/A)"}},{"question":"age_min","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"18"}},{"question":"age_subgroup","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Age unclear"}},{"question":"comorbidity_subgroup","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"Depression"}},{"question":"comorbidity_subgroup","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"Anxiety"}},{"question":"other_info_race_ethnicity","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"presentation","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"index_test","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"Self report"}},{"question":"ML","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"No"}},{"question":"validation_dataset","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"reference_standard_type","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Clinical diagnosis"}},{"question":"reference_standard_description","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Diagnosed with ADHD based on the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) and the  ACDS (Adult ADHD Clinician Diagnostic Scale)"}},{"question":"Who performed the diagnosis?","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Specialist (e.g., mental health)"}},{"question":"Timing of the outcome data","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Concurrent"}},{"question":"test_description_self","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"PDI-4 (Provisional Diagnostic Instrument-4),a 17-item screening tool designed to assess generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive episode (MDE), past\/present mania, and adult ADHD.

METHOD: Male and female patients with schizophrenia (n=26) and adult ADHD (n=24) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM IV) diagnostic criteria and healthy controls (n=58) comprised the analysis set (n=108) of the total number of study participants (n=119). Coded sets of randomized ABR recordings were analysed by an independent party blinded to clinical diagnoses before a joint code-breaking session. RESULTS: The ABR profiling test for schizophrenia identified schizophrenia patients versus controls with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 93.1%. The ADHD test identified patients with adult ADHD versus controls with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 91.4%. CONCLUSION: The ABR profiling tests discriminated schizophrenia and ADHD versus healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. The methods deserve to be further explored in larger clinical studies including a broad range of psychiatric disorders to determine their utility as potential diagnostic biomarkers.","tags":{"Accession Number":"28803577","Author Address":"Department of Neuroscience, Psychiatry,Uppsala University,Uppsala University Hospital,Uppsala,Sweden.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jun","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:29","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:29","DOI":"10.1017\/neu.2017.24","Epub Date":"2017\/08\/15","ISSN":"0924-2708","Issue":"3","Journal":"Acta Neuropsychiatr","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/diagnosis\/*physiopathology Biomarkers Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem\/*physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Schizophrenia\/diagnosis\/*physiopathology Sensitivity and Specificity Young Adult Adhd Erp psychiatric disorders schizophrenia","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1601-5215 Juselius Baghdassarian, Eva Orcid: 0000-0001-9786-5403 Nilsson Markhed, Maria Lindstr\u00f6m, Eva Nilsson, Bj\u00f6rn M Lewander, Tommy Journal Article England Acta Neuropsychiatr. 2018 Jun;30(3):137-147. doi: 10.1017\/neu.2017.24.

Experimental results showed the highest testing accuracy of 93.3% under the eyes-open, 90% under the eyes-closed, and 100% under the CPT condition.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the structure and symptoms most predictive of DSM-IV adult ADHD. DESIGN: The data are from clinical interviews in enriched subsamples of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (n = 131) and a survey of a large managed health care plan (n = 214). The physician-administered Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) was used to assess childhood ADHD and expanded symptoms of current adult ADHD. Analyses examined the stability of symptoms from childhood to adulthood, the structure of adult ADHD, and the adult symptoms most predictive of current clinical diagnoses. SETTING: The ACDS was administered telephonically by clinical research interviewers with extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD. PARTICIPANTS: An enriched sample of community respondents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnoses of DSM-IV \/ACDS adult ADHD. RESULTS: Almost half of the respondents (45.7%) who had childhood ADHD continued to meet the full DSM-IV criteria for current adult ADHD, with 94.9% of these patients having current attention-deficit disorder and 34.6% having current hyperactivity disorder. Adult persistence was much greater for inattention than for hyperactivity\/impulsivity. Additional respondents met the full criteria for current adult ADHD despite not having met the full childhood criteria. A 3-factor structure of adult symptoms included executive functioning (EF), inattention\/hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Stepwise logistic regression found EF problems to be the most consistent and discriminating predictors of adult DSM-IV \/ACDS ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings document the greater persistence of inattentive than of hyperactive\/impulsive childhood symptoms of ADHD in adulthood but also show that inattention is not specific to ADHD because it is strongly associated with other adult mental disorders. In comparison, EF problems are more specific and consistently important predictors of DSM-IV adult ADHD despite not being in the DSM-IV, suggesting that the number of EF symptoms should be increased in the DSM-V\/ICD-11.","tags":{"Accession Number":"21041618","Author Address":"Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, 180 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115, USA. kessler@hcp.med.harvard.edu","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Nov","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:29","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:29","DOI":"10.1001\/archgenpsychiatry.2010.146","Epub Date":"2010\/11\/03","ISSN":"0003-990X (Print) 0003-990x","Issue":"11","Journal":"Arch Gen Psychiatry","Keywords":"Adolescent Adult Age Factors Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/epidemiology\/psychology Child Data Collection\/statistics & numerical data Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Factor Analysis, Statistical Female Health Status Humans Interviews as Topic\/methods Logistic Models Male Predictive Value of Tests Psychiatric Status Rating Scales\/*statistics & numerical data Psychometrics Severity of Illness Index Surveys and Questionnaires","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","NIHMSID":"NIHMS266485","Notes":"1538-3636 Kessler, Ronald C Green, Jennifer Greif Adler, Lenard A Barkley, Russell A Chatterji, Somnath Faraone, Stephen V Finkelman, Matthew Greenhill, Laurence L Gruber, Michael J Jewell, Mark Russo, Leo J Sampson, Nancy A Van Brunt, David L U01 MH060220\/MH\/NIMH NIH HHS\/United States U01-MH60220\/MH\/NIMH NIH HHS\/United States Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

However, relatively little is known about functional connectivity in adult ADHD, and how it is linked with the heritability of ADHD. METHODS: We measured eyes-open and eyes-closed resting electroencephalography (EEG) from 38 adults with ADHD, 45 1st degree relatives of people with ADHD and 51 healthy controls. Functional connectivity among all scalp channels was calculated using a weighted phase lag index for delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. A machine learning analysis using penalized linear regression was used to identify if connectivity features (10,080 connectivity pairs) could predict ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, we examined if EEG connectivity could accurately classify participants into ADHD, 1st degree relatives and\/or control groups. RESULTS: Hyperactive symptoms were best predicted by eyes-open EEG connectivity in delta, beta and gamma bands. Inattentive symptoms were predicted by eyes-open EEG connectivity in delta, alpha and gamma bands, and eyes-closed EEG connectivity in delta and gamma bands. EEG connectivity features did not reliably classify participants into groups. CONCLUSIONS: EEG connectivity may represent a neuromarker for ADHD symptoms. SIGNIFICANCE: EEG connectivity may help elucidate the neural basis of adult ADHD symptoms.","tags":{"Accession Number":"31506235","Author Address":"Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential component representing pre-attentive auditory processing, which is closely associated with cognitive status. We investigated MMN features as biomarkers to classify drug-naive adult patients with ADHD and healthy controls (HCs). Sensor-level features (amplitude and latency) and source-level features (source activation) of MMN were investigated and compared between the electroencephalograms of 34 patients with ADHD and 45 HCs using a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Correlations between MMN features and ADHD symptoms were analyzed. Finally, we applied machine learning to differentiate the two groups using sensor- and source-level features of MMN. Adult patients with ADHD showed significantly lower MMN amplitudes at the frontocentral electrodes and reduced MMN source activation in the frontal, temporal, and limbic lobes, which were closely associated with MMN generators and ADHD pathophysiology. Source activities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The best classification performance for adult ADHD patients and HCs showed an 81.01% accuracy, 82.35% sensitivity, and 80.00% specificity based on MMN source activity features. Our results suggest that abnormal MMN reflects the adult ADHD patients' pathophysiological characteristics and might serve clinically as a neuromarker of adult ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"34537812","Author Address":"Department of Human-Computer Interaction, Hanyang University, Ansan, Republic of Korea.

This study aimed to identify cutoff scores on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS-S:L) that can definitively rule out the presence of ADHD. Among 102 clinically diagnosed adult ADHD participants and 448 non-ADHD participants who completed the CAARS-S:L, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis established a perfectly discriminant cutoff T-score of <44 on the ADHD Symptoms Total subscale when looking at any ADHD diagnosis and <54 on the Inattentive Symptoms subscale when looking at individuals diagnosed with the inattentive subtype of ADHD. Alternative cutoffs of <54 (ADHD Symptoms Total subscale) and <63 (Inattentive Symptoms subscale) were also identified, both with a sensitivity of 0.95 or higher. Furthermore, the analysis found the ADHD Index to be a poor predictor of a negative ADHD diagnosis, suggesting against the use of this scale for cutoff determination. Despite this limitation, these findings indicate that with specific cutoffs, the CAARS-S:L may have the potential to conclusively rule out ADHD, effectively streamlining the diagnostic process and reducing unnecessary comprehensive assessments in clear negative cases.","tags":{"Accession Number":"38569190","Author Address":"Regional Assessment & Resource Centre, Queens University, Kingston, ON, Canada.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Apr 3","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:30","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:30","DOI":"10.1080\/23279095.2024.2336204","Epub Date":"2024\/04\/03","ISSN":"2327-9095","Journal":"Appl Neuropsychol Adult","Keywords":"Clinical Neuropsychology assessment\/diagnosis diagnosis tests","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"2327-9109 Kwan, Dylan Orcid: 0009-0008-8051-1156 Davin, Nathaniel Orcid: 0000-0002-2687-4617 Harrison, Allyson G Orcid: 0000-0002-0426-2011 Gillie, Sienna Journal Article United States Appl Neuropsychol Adult. 2024 Apr 3:1-11. doi: 10.1080\/23279095.2024.2336204.","Pages":"1-11","Short Title":"Determining cutoff scores on the Conners' adult ADHD rating scales that can definitively rule out the presence of ADHD in a clinical sample","Type":"JOUR","Year":"2024"},"attachments":["490_Kwan 2024.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"24333":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer7","key":"","data":[{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"CAARS-S:L ADHD Symptoms Total Scale is a T-score of <44 was identified to definitively rule out ADHD with 100% sensitivity, while a score of <54 had 95% sensitivity.

A screening tool for ADHD and comorbid mental health disorders is essential, as most adult ADHD is comorbid with several mental health disorders. The current pilot study enrolled 955 consecutive patients attending a tertiary mental health center in Canada and who completed EarlyDetect assessment, with 45.2% of patients diagnosed with ADHD. The best ADHD classification model using composite scoring achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.788, showing a 2.1% increase compared to standalone ADHD screening, detecting four more patients with ADHD per 100 patients. The classification model including ADHD with comorbidity was also successful (balanced accuracy\u2009=\u20090.712). The results suggest the novel screening method can improve ADHD detection accuracy and inform the risk of ADHD with comorbidity, and may further inform specific comorbidity including MDD and BD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"36367134","Author Address":"University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

MANOVA analyses and subsequent univariate tests indicated that most of the neuropsychological measures discriminated between the two groups. To address clinical significance diagnostic classification rates were also generated for each measure individually, and for the battery as a whole. Levels of positive predictive power (PPP) for each of the 6 measures (83-100%) indicated that abnormal scores on these tests were good predictors of ADHD. However, estimates of negative predictive power (NPP) suggested that normal scores poorly predicted the absence of ADHD. When classification rates were calculated for the overall battery classification accuracy improved substantially. Thus, neuropsychological tests can differentiate adults suffering from ADHD from adults without ADHD, while also providing good classification accuracy. Finally, the pattern of neurobehavioral impairments exemplified through the Summary Index scores was interpreted as consistent with conceptualizations of ADHD depicting mild neurologic dysfunction in networks associated with the frontal lobes.","tags":{"Accession Number":"10217922","Author Address":"Hartford Hospital, USA. dlovejo@harthosp.org","Database

Moreover, identifying ADHD in AUD patients is time-consuming and difficult. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of two self-report screening instruments for adult ADHD in AUD patients. METHODS: 404 adults seeking residential treatment for AUD were screened using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Screening Self-Rating (CAARS-S-SR) and the Adult ADHD Rating Scale (ASRS). Results were compared with ADHD diagnosis obtained from a stepped approach: first, a structured interview (Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults 2.0.; DIVA) was applied; second, probable ADHD diagnoses had to be confirmed by two expert clinicians. RESULTS: At the previously reported cut-off values, ASRS and CAARS-S-SR showed low sensitivities of 57.1 and 70.6%. A high number of false negative results (NPV ASRS: 89.5%; CAARS-S-SR: 92.3%) indicates underreporting of ADHD symptoms. Sensitivity improved at lower cut-off (ASRS\u2009\u2265\u200911; CAARS-S-SR \u226560) or with a combination of both instruments at lower cut-offs. Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the combination of ASRS and CAARS-S-SR was superior to the AUCs of the single questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Underreporting of ADHD symptoms in ASRS and CAARS-S-SR of AUD patients requires lower cut-off values to detect the majority of ADHD, albeit at the expense of an increased rate of false-positive results. Cut-off values should be adjusted to the clinical setting. Clinicians should take into consideration that a negative screening result does not necessarily imply absence of ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"30583265","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Department of Addictive Behavior and Addiction Medicine, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany; Feuerlein Center of Translational Addiction Medicine, Germany.

The study aimed to validate self-report instruments for assessment of adult ADHD in a sample of treatment-seeking adults attending community drug and alcohol teams. METHODS: : Adult patients attending 3 National Health Service (NHS) community drug and alcohol teams in England completed several self-report instruments for assessment of adult ADHD symptoms, and a diagnosis of adult ADHD was determined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria with an interview with both the patient and an informant. RESULTS: : One hundred seven subjects completed the project. Thirty-nine percent of subjects had an undisputed diagnosis of adult ADHD. The most accurate self-report instrument for diagnosis of adult ADHD was the Connors Adult ADHD Rating Scale Self-report Long version-a cutoff of 91 of 198 gave a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 83%. Analysis of the WHO Adult ADHD Self-report Screener confirmed the optimal recommended cutoff as 12 of 13 giving 89% sensitivity and 83% specificity for adult ADHD against diagnostic interview. Although the Wender Utah adult ADHD scale is designed to retrospectively assess symptoms of ADHD in childhood it gave a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 70% for diagnosis of ADHD in adults. CONCLUSION: : The symptoms of ADHD in adults can be reliably assessed by self-report instruments.","tags":{"Accession Number":"21769011","Author Address":"From the Department of General Psychiatry

METHODS: A normative sample was recruited, and additional participants came from trials involving ADHD, anxiety, or depression. Using the investigator-administered WRAADDS, participants in the ADHD sample were classified as ADHD inattentive presentation or ADHD emotional dysregulation presentation. RESULTS: In the ADHD sample, the SR-WRAADDS correlated with the investigator-rated version WRAADDS (P < .001). In comparing adults with ADHD with normal controls, all SR-WRAADDS domains demonstrated discriminate validity (P < .001); a cut point was identified yielding sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 89%. In comparison, in screening for ADHD in depression or anxiety disorders, sensitivity was 87% and specificity, 49%. Internal consistency was satisfactory (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.78; split-half reliability r = 0.92). Factor analysis yielded a 2-factor solution: one reflected emotional dysregulation; the other, inattention and disorganization. Detecting ADHD emotional dysregulation presentation within the ADHD sample, as the \"disorder-of-interest,\" SR-WRAADDS and the investigator-rated WRAADDS agreement was 72% (sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 49%). The SR-WRAADDS detected a methylphenidate vs placebo treatment effect (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the SR-WRAADDS support its use in research and clinical practice.

The aim of the present study was to calculate ADHD prevalence in a large non-clinical sample of medical students using a stepwise design and to determine whether ADHD diagnosis varies if interviewees use additional probing procedures to obtain examples of positive DSM items. METHODS: A total of 726 students were screened with the Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and invited for an interview with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) adapted for adults. RESULTS: The ASRS was positive for 247 students (37%), although only 83 (7.9%) received an ADHD diagnosis. ASRS sensitivity and specificity rates were 0.97 and 0.40, respectively. Probing procedures were used with a subgroup of 226 students, which decreased the number of ADHD diagnoses to 12 (4.5%). CONCLUSION: Probing for an individual's real-life examples during the K-SADS interview almost halved ADHD prevalence rate based on the ASRS and K-SADS, which rendered the rate consistent with that typically reported for young adults. In reclassified cases, although examples of inattention did not match the corresponding DSM item, they often referred to another DSM inattention item.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29451590","Author Address":"Instituto D'Or de Pesquisae Ensino (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

The estimated prevalence of ADHD in the adult population is between 0.3% and 5%. Recent interest in the condition in adults has been accompanied by the appearance of a number of readily available scales for screening adults and aiding in the diagnosis of ADHD in this age group. However, there are few published data on the validity and reliability of such measures. We examined the diagnostic and screening utility of three ADHD scales (Adult Rating Scale [ARS], Attention-Deficit Scales for Adults [ADSA], and Symptom Inventory for ADHD) in 82 adults presenting for ADHD evaluation. All three instruments were sensitive to the presence of symptoms in adults with ADHD (correctly identifying 78% to 92% of patients with ADHD), but a high proportion of individuals with non-ADHD diagnoses screened positive (incorrectly identifying between 36% and 67% of non-ADHD patients). Our results suggest that the use of such measures for screening and as an aid in diagnosis should be approached with considerable caution.","tags":{"Accession Number":"15124147","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98104-2499, USA.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"May-Jun","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:32","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:32","DOI":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2004.02.006","Epub Date":"2004\/05\/05","ISSN":"0010-440X (Print) 0010-440x","Issue":"3","Journal":"Compr Psychiatry","Keywords":"Adult Age Distribution Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/complications\/*diagnosis Depression\/complications Discriminant Analysis Dysthymic Disorder\/complications Female Humans Interview, Psychological Male Mass Screening\/*methods *Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reproducibility of Results *Self Disclosure Sensitivity and Specificity Washington","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"McCann, Barbara S Roy-Byrne, Peter Journal Article United States Compr Psychiatry. 2004 May-Jun;45(3):175-83. doi: 10.1016\/j.comppsych.2004.02.006.","Pages":"175-83","Short Title":"Screening and diagnostic utility of self-report attention deficit hyperactivity disorder scales in adults","Type":"JOUR","Volume":"45","Year":"2004"},"attachments":["603_McCann 2004.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"24348":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer7","key":"","data":[{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"The study specifically examines the diagnostic accuracy of tools (self-report measures) for ADHD in a specialty clinic setting and compares how their performance might vary based on patient characteristics, such as comorbidities (depression or dysthymia)","answer":"KQ1a"}},{"question":"ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"McCann, 2004{#603}"}},{"question":"trial_ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ID N\/A"}},{"question":"location","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"US"}},{"question":"sites","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Single center"}},{"question":"funding","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Unclear"}},{"question":"setting","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"ADHD specialty clinic","answer":"Specialty care"}},{"question":"size","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"82"}},{"question":"ADHDsample","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Adults presenting to a university-affiliated ADHD specialty clinic based on suspected ADHD, diagnosed with ADHD through a structured clinical interview incorporating DSM-IV criteria, corroborating documents, and family interviews."}},{"question":"participants_other","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Adults presenting to the same ADHD specialty clinic for evaluation but diagnosed with non-ADHD conditions through structured clinical interviews, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric conditions."}},{"question":"other_participant_category","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"They were not neurotypical or unselected;

Similar impairments have been described for adults with persistent ADHD, but an extensive investigation of neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of adult patients is currently lacking. We systematically examined neuropsychological performance on tasks measuring EF, delay discounting, time estimation and response variability using univariate ANCOVA's comparing patients with persistent ADHD (N=133, 42% male, mean age 36) and healthy adults (N=132, 40% male, mean age 36). In addition, we tested which combination of variables provided the highest accuracy in predicting ADHD diagnosis. We also estimated for each individual the severity of neuropsychological dysfunctioning. Lastly, we investigated potential effects of stimulant medication and a history of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) on performance. Compared to healthy adults, patients with ADHD showed impaired EF, were more impulsive, and more variable in responding. However, effect sizes were small to moderate (range: 0.05-0.70) and 11% of patients did not show neuropsychological dysfunctioning. The best fitting model predicting ADHD included measures from distinct cognitive domains (82.1% specificity, 64.9% sensitivity). Furthermore, patients receiving stimulant medication or with a history of MDD were not distinctively impaired. To conclude, while adults with ADHD as a group are impaired on several cognitive domains, the results confirm that adult ADHD is neuropsychologically heterogeneous. This provides a starting point to investigate individual differences in terms of impaired cognitive pathways.","tags":{"Accession Number":"26336867","Author Address":"Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

However, most of the studies are limited to group differences in children. Independent component analysis (ICA) separates a set of mixed event-related potentials into a corresponding set of statistically independent source signals, which are likely to represent different functional processes. Using a support vector machine (SVM), a classification method originating from machine learning, this study aimed at investigating the use of such independent ERP components in differentiating adult ADHD patients from non-clinical controls by selecting a most informative feature set. A second aim was to validate the predictive power of the SVM classifier by means of an independent ADHD sample recruited at a different laboratory. METHODS: Two groups of age-matched adults (75 ADHD, 75 controls) performed a visual two stimulus go\/no-go task. ERP responses were decomposed into independent components, and a selected set of independent ERP component features was used for SVM classification. RESULTS: Using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, classification accuracy was 91%. Predictive power of the SVM classifier was verified on the basis of the independent ADHD sample (17 ADHD patients), resulting in a classification accuracy of 94%. The latency and amplitude measures which in combination differentiated best between ADHD patients and non-clinical subjects primarily originated from independent components associated with inhibitory and other executive operations. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that ERPs can substantially contribute to the diagnosis of ADHD when combined with up-to-date methods.","tags":{"Accession Number":"21771289","Author Address":"Brain and Trauma Foundation Grisons, Poststrasse 22, 7000 Chur, Switzerland.

Neuroalgorithms are models of multidimensional brain networks by means of which ADHD patient data can be separated from healthy control data.Methods: Spontaneous electroencephalographic and event-related potential (ERP) data were collected three times over the course of 2 years from a multicentre sample of adults comprising 181 patients with ADHD and 147 healthy controls. Spectral power and ERP amplitude and latency measures were used as input data for a semi-automatic machine-learning framework.Results: ADHD patients and healthy controls could be classified with a sensitivity ranging from 75% to 83% and specificity values of 71% to 77%. In the analysis of the repeated measurements, sensitivity values of the selected logistic regression model remained high (72% and 76%), while specificity values slightly decreased over time (64% and 67%).Conclusions: Implementation of the system in clinical practice requires facilities to track affected networks, as well as expertise in neuropathophysiology. Therefore, the use of neuroalgorithms can enhance the diagnostic process by making it less subjective and more reliable and linking it to the underlying pathology.","tags":{"Accession Number":"30990349","Author Address":"Brain and Trauma Foundation Grisons\/Switzerland, Chur, Switzerland.

METHOD: A sample of 238 undergraduate students was recruited and asked to simulate ADHD (ADHD simulators) or respond honestly (controls) on the PAI. Archival data (n = 541) from individuals diagnosed with clinical ADHD, no diagnosis, learning disorder, mood\/anxiety, comorbid ADHD-mood\/anxiety, or suspect effort were used. RESULTS: Few individuals scored above the cutoffs on PAI validity scales. When alternative cutoff scores were examined, cutoffs of \u226577 on the Negative Impression Management (NIM) scale, \u22653 on the Malingering Index (MAL), and \u22651 on the Rogers Discriminant Function (RDF) yielded excellent specificity in all groups and sensitivities of .33, .30, and .20, respectively. CONCLUSION: Individuals who were asked to simulate ADHD easily manipulate the PAI; however, alternative cutoff scores proposed for PAI validity indices may improve the detection of feigned ADHD symptoms.","tags":{"Accession Number":"25204276","Author Address":"Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA mandimusso@gmail.com.

METHODS: Thirty adults with ADHD, aged 18-43, were evaluated with the AQT color (C), form (F) and color-form combination (CF) naming tests before and after medication with methylphenidate. Thirty age- and sex-matched normal adults served as controls. RESULTS: Among adults with ADHD, pre-medication naming times (s) for C, F, and CF were significantly longer and overhead [CF - (C + F)] significantly larger than post-medication. Before medication, C, F and CF naming and processing efficiency (overhead) (s) differed significantly between ADHD adults and controls. After medication, there were no significant differences between groups. When we used fail criteria for dual-dimension naming (> 60 s) and overhead (processing efficiency) (> + 6 s) together the sensitivity was 93% and specificity 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Within the study limitations, findings suggest that the processing-speed and efficiency measures in AQT may be used to screen adults for executive dysfunction and reduced cognitive control associated with ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"22121933","Author Address":"Vesterbro-Enghave Psykiatrisk Center, Hvidovre Hospital Department of Psychiatry, Copenhagen, Denmark.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Sep","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:33","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:33","DOI":"10.3109\/13651501.2011.582538","Epub Date":"2011\/11\/30","ISSN":"1365-1501","Issue":"3","Journal":"Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract","Keywords":"Adolescent Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/drug therapy\/*psychology Central Nervous System Stimulants\/therapeutic use Cognition\/drug effects\/*physiology Female Humans Male Methylphenidate\/therapeutic use Neuropsychological Tests Reaction Time\/drug effects\/physiology Sensitivity and Specificity Young Adult","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1471-1788 Nielsen, Niels Peter Wiig, Elisabeth Hemmersam Comparative Study Journal Article England Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract. 2011 Sep;15(3):219-27. doi: 10.3109\/13651501.2011.582538.

METHOD: A cross sectional international multi-center study in 10 countries was conducted in treatment seeking SUD patients. A sample of 1263 patients with both MINI-Plus and CAADID was analyzed to determine the psychometric properties of the MINI-Plus. RESULTS: According to the CAADID, 179 patients (14.2%) met criteria for adult ADHD, whereas according to the MINI-Plus 227 patients (18.0%) were identified as having adult ADHD. Sensitivity of the MINI-Plus ADHD module was 74%, specificity was 91%, positive predictive value was 60% and negative predictive value was 96%. Kappa was 0.60. CONCLUSION: The MINI-Plus has acceptable criterion validity for the screening of adult ADHD in treatment seeking SUD patients. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: On the basis of the results, The MINI-Plus may be used for the screening of ADHD in SUD patients.","tags":{"Accession Number":"32561156","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

ADHD is sometimes first recognised in young adulthood because ADHD symptoms may be misattributed to autism due to superficial overlap in presentation and diagnostic overshadowing. It should be investigated whether ADHD questionnaires are accurate in screening symptoms in young adults with autism. The current study examined this. METHODS: Participants were autistic young adults (N\u2009=\u2009119) who took part in the Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP), a population-based cohort. ADHD research diagnoses were obtained through the parent-informed Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment. Parents and young adults (self-report sample N\u2009=\u200971) completed ADHD questionnaires (Aberrant Behavior Checklist hyperactivity\/non-compliance subscale, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales ADHD Index, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ADHD subscale). Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to explore if the questionnaires discriminated ADHD cases from non-cases. To assess whether results varied by intellectual functioning, subgroup analyses were completed for those with an IQ\u2009\u2265\u200970 vs. <70. RESULTS: Weighted ADHD rates were high. Overall although the measures were performing at or close to adequate levels (area under the curve was 0.66 to 0.79 for parent-report and 0.70 to 0.65 for self-report), no single measure met adequate thresholds for sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. Tool performance was not different for those with an IQ\u2009\u2265\u200970 vs. <70. CONCLUSION: No single measure reported adequate performance for distinguishing ADHD from non-ADHD cases in this sample of young autistic adults. Use of current thresholds may lead to under-diagnosis.","tags":{"Accession Number":"37898580","Author Address":"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. melanie.palmer@kcl.ac.uk.

METHOD: Of 108 patients, 60 were diagnosed with ADHD. The Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA 2.0) and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) v.1.1 together with eight neuropsychological tests were investigated. RESULTS: All instruments showed poor discriminative ability except for the DIVA, which showed a relatively good ability to discriminate between the groups (sensitivity = 90.0; specificity = 72.9). A logistic regression analysis model with the DIVA and measures of inattention, impulsivity, and activity from continuous performance tests (CPTs) showed a sensitivity of 90.0 and a specificity of 83.3. CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological tests have a poor ability to discriminate between patients diagnosed with ADHD and patients not diagnosed with ADHD, but variables from CPT tests can contribute to increasing the specificity by 10% if used in combination with the DIVA.","tags":{"Accession Number":"26681530","Author Address":"1 Neuropsychological Clinic, County Hospital, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden. 2 Centre for clinical research, Uppsala University, County council of V\u00e4stmanland, County Hospital, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Sep","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:34","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:34","DOI":"10.1177\/1087054715618788","Epub Date":"2015\/12\/19","ISSN":"1087-0547","Issue":"11","Journal":"J Atten Disord","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/psychology Female Humans Impulsive Behavior Male *Neuropsychological Tests Self Concept Self Report Sensitivity and Specificity adult ADHD diagnostic validity sensitivity specificity","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1557-1246 Pettersson, Richard S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Staffan Nilsson, Kent W Evaluation Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Validation Study United States J Atten Disord. 2018 Sep;22(11):1019-1031. doi: 10.1177\/1087054715618788.

The resting electroencephalogram (EEG) provides non-invasive spectral markers of brain function and development. Their accuracy as ADHD markers is increasingly questioned but may improve with pattern classification. METHODS: This study provides an integrated analysis of ADHD and developmental effects in children and adults using regression analysis and support vector machine classification of spectral resting (eyes-closed) EEG biomarkers in order to clarify their diagnostic value. RESULTS: ADHD effects on EEG strongly depend on age and frequency. We observed typical non-linear developmental decreases in delta and theta power for both ADHD and control groups. However, for ADHD adults we found a slowing in alpha frequency combined with a higher power in alpha-1 (8-10Hz) and beta (13-30Hz). Support vector machine classification of ADHD adults versus controls yielded a notable cross validated sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 83% using power and central frequency from all frequency bands. ADHD children were not classified convincingly with these markers. CONCLUSIONS: Resting state electrophysiology is altered in ADHD, and these electrophysiological impairments persist into adulthood. SIGNIFICANCE: Spectral biomarkers may have both diagnostic and prognostic value.","tags":{"Accession Number":"24582383","Author Address":"Center for MR-Research, University Children's Hospital, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland; Center for Integrative Human Physiology (ZIHP), University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.

METHODS: Power spectra of resting EEG, CSD and gIC (19 channels, linked ears reference, eyes open\/closed) from 96 ADHD and 376 healthy adults were compared between eyes open and eyes closed conditions, and between groups of subjects. RESULTS: Pattern of differences in gIC and CSD spectral power between conditions was approximately similar, whereas it was more widely spatially distributed for EEG. Size effect (Cohen's d) of differences in gIC and CSD spectral power between groups of subjects was considerably greater than in the case of EEG. Significant reduction of gIC and CSD spectral power depending on conditions was found in ADHD patients. Reducing power in a wide frequency range in the fronto-central areas is a common phenomenon regardless of whether the eyes were open or closed. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral power of local EEG activity isolated by gICA or CSD in the fronto-central areas may be a suitable marker for discrimination of ADHD and healthy adults. SIGNIFICANCE: Spectral analysis of gIC and CSD provides better sensitivity to discriminate ADHD and healthy adults.","tags":{"Accession Number":"23871197","Author Address":"N.P.

METHOD: The participants consisted of 68 young adults, 34 with ADHD. Participants completed the MARS, CAT-A, and WMT validity measures. RESULTS: The MARS SV index-4 demonstrated higher sensitivity rates for simulated malingering (61.8%) at close to optimal specificity (88.2%) compared to two published tests (which had sensitivity <42% at specificity >90%).

Instead of actual factors scores, we employed \"item averages\" calculated by the average score of each item comprising that factor. We did not present a factor analysis of the WURS-25. Herein we identify items of the full WURS that are redundant or not part of any of the scale's five factors. Removing these items produced a shortened version, the WURS-45. We performed a logistic regression using actual factor loadings as well as factors based on item averages, and compared major depressive disorder (MDD) to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients in the same analysis. We performed exploratory factor analysis with the WURS-45 items. We then performed logistic regressions and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses with the WURS-45 and WURS-25 factors. No increase in specificity or sensitivity arose when actual factors scores were used as opposed to factor scores from item averages. MDD and GAD ROC curves were very similar, supporting combining MDD with GAD patients into a single group. WURS-45 factors paralleled those derived from the full WURS. ROC curves, logistic regression and confusion tables showed the WURS-45 preserved the excellent diagnostic separation produced by the full WURS. Similar analyses showed WURS-25 scoring using its three factors improved its diagnostic utility. The WURS-45 has reduced redundancy with minimal loss in discriminatory power. Analysis of the WURS-25 using factor scores boosts its performance. Both versions of the scale provide clinical information describing childhood ADHD and are useful in separating adult patients with ADHD from those with MDD or GAD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"34235235","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.

In conventional SPECT scans, the typical tomographic slices are produced. In three-dimensional thresholded SPECT scans, pixels representing activity below a certain threshold are discarded. A retrospective analysis of 427 patients shows that three-dimensional thresholded SPECT scans yield a sensitivity for predicting clinical attention deficit hyperactivity disorder of 54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 46%-61%; specificity, 76%; 95% CI, 71%-81%] compared with 4% sensitivity [95% CI, 2%-8%; specificity, 97%; 95% CI, 94%-98%] for conventional SPECT scans. For 170 of the patients originating from a general psychiatry practice, conventional SPECT showed 10% sensitivity (95% CI, 4%-23%) and 98% specificity (95% CI, 93%-99%), whereas three-dimensional thresholded SPECT showed 83% sensitivity (95% CI, 68%-91%) and 77% specificity (95% CI, 69%-83%). These findings indicate that a much stronger signal is obtained when the three-dimensional thresholded SPECT scan is performed rather than the conventional SPECT scan in detecting attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and suggest similar results may be obtained for other psychiatric disorders.","tags":{"Accession Number":"26037855","Author Address":"From Sheppard Associates, Toronto, ON,

METHODS: Spatio-temporal interrelations and synchronicity of multi-sited ERP activity peaks were extracted in a group of 13 ADHD patients and 13 control subjects for the No-go stimulus in a Go\/No-go task. Participants were scored by cross-validation against the most discriminative ensuing group patterns and scores were correlated to neuropsychological evaluation scores. RESULTS: A distinct frontal-central-parietal pattern in the delta frequency range, dominant at the P3 latency, was unraveled in controls, while central activity in the theta and alpha frequency ranges predominated in the ADHD pattern, involving early ERP components (P1-N1-P2-N2). Cross-validation based on this analysis yielded 92% specificity and 84% sensitivity and individual scores correlated well with behavioral assessments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ADHD group was more characterized by the process of exerting attention in the early monitoring stages of the No-go signal while the controls were more characterized by the process of inhibiting the response to that signal. SIGNIFICANCE: The BNA method may provide both diagnostic and drug development tools for use in diverse neurological disorders.","tags":{"Accession Number":"22261156","Author Address":"ElMindA Ltd., Herzliya, Israel.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Aug","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","DOI":"10.1016\/j.clinph.2011.12.010","Epub Date":"2012\/01\/21","ISSN":"1388-2457","Issue":"8","Journal":"Clin Neurophysiol","Keywords":"Acoustic Stimulation Adult Attention\/physiology Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*physiopathology Brain Mapping\/*methods Cerebral Cortex\/*physiopathology Electroencephalography Evoked Potentials\/*physiology Female Humans Male Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms\/*physiopathology Reaction Time\/physiology Sensitivity and Specificity","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1872-8952 Shahaf, G Reches, A Pinchuk, N Fisher, T Ben Bashat, G Kanter, A Tauber, I Kerem, D Laufer, I Aharon-Peretz, J Pratt, H Geva, A B Journal Article Netherlands Clin Neurophysiol. 2012 Aug;123(8):1568-80. doi: 10.1016\/j.clinph.2011.12.010.

The present study examined the ability of validity indicators on the widely used Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) to distinguish between individuals experiencing genuine ADHD symptoms and individuals instructed to present with ADHD symptomatology for secondary gain. Sixty-six participants who successfully simulated ADHD (based on elevations on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale; Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, 1998) were compared with a sample of undergraduate students meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD (N = 22) and an archival sample of adults who received an ADHD diagnosis at a university psychology clinic following a comprehensive psychological evaluation (N = 41). Successful simulators obtained significantly higher scores on all relevant PAI validity indicators compared with the clinical and archival comparison samples, with the Rogers Discriminant Function demonstrating the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = .86). Traditional cut scores on the Negative Impression (NIM) validity scale used to designate probable malingering, however, were not sensitive to simulated ADHD symptoms, although they did demonstrate excellent specificity. The PAI may be informative as an indicator of potentially exaggerated or malingered symptom presentation, but alternative cut scores for symptom validity indicators may be necessary to maximize its utility in these particular types of psychological evaluations.

However, few studies have examined the differential validity of these kinds of instruments in psychiatric samples. AIMS: To examine the discriminative validity of two self-report scales (ADHD Self-Report Scale [ASRS v.1.1], Current Symptom Scale [CSS]) and a continuous performance test with measures of motor activity (QBTest Plus). METHODS: The interrelation between the instruments, and their abilities to differentiate between patients with an ADHD diagnosis and non-ADHD patients referred for psychiatric assessment were examined in a naturalistic sample of 61 adult patients. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the dichotomized versions of the test variables in all tests ranged from 0.61 to 0.71. The ASRS and CSS exhibited sensitivity of 90.2% and 85.4%, and specificity of 35.0% and 40.0%, respectively. Variables from the QBTest Plus showed the opposite result for the variables QBImpulsivity and QBInattention, with sensitivity of 58.5% and 36.3% and specificity of 80.0% and 100.0%. Sensitivity and specificity of QBActivity were 68.3% and 65.0%, respectively. A stepwise discriminant function analysis showed that two variables from the QBTest Plus--QBInattention and QBActivity--accounted for 22.8% of the between-group variability, with the strongest predictor being QBInattention. The function yielded an overall correct classification of 72.1%. The classification correctly identified 87.8% of patients diagnosed with ADHD and 40.0% of non-ADHD patients. CONCLUSION: The discriminant validity of self-rating scales and the more objective measure of ADHD symptoms are poor and should be integrated generally with other sources of data.","tags":{"Accession Number":"23527787","Author Address":"Neuropsychologist, Neuropsychological Clinic, Central Hospital , 721 89, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s , Sweden .","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jan","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","DOI":"10.3109\/08039488.2012.762940","Epub Date":"2013\/03\/27","ISSN":"0803-9488","Issue":"1","Journal":"Nord J Psychiatry","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/classification\/*diagnosis\/psychology Checklist Diagnosis, Differential Discriminant Analysis Executive Function Female Humans Male Middle Aged Psychiatric Status Rating Scales\/*standards Psychometrics\/*instrumentation Psychomotor Performance\/*physiology Qualitative Research ROC Curve Sensitivity and Specificity Surveys and Questionnaires Sweden","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1502-4725 S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Staffan Pettersson, Richard Nilsson, Kent W Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England Nord J Psychiatry. 2014 Jan;68(1):30-7. doi: 10.3109\/08039488.2012.762940.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic utility of instruments commonly used in the assessment of adults presenting with symptoms of ADHD. METHODS: We reviewed several widely used self-report and laboratory measures and empirically examined the utility of the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults (Brown ADD Scale) and the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in differentially identifying adults with ADHD and those with other Axis I disorders. RESULTS: Ninety-three adults who self-referred to the ADHD program for adults at a university medical center participated in the study. Of these, 44 had ADHD combined subtype (ADHD-CB), and 26 had ADHD, predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-IA). Thirty-three non-ADHD adults diagnosed with Axis I mood or anxiety disorders comprised an \"Other Psychiatric\" group. Rates of comorbid disorders, including substance abuse, in the ADHD groups were typical of those reported in the adult ADHD literature. Data on the Brown ADD Scale and on the CPT were available for subsets of 61 and 46 participants, respectively. Analyses showed that the ADHD-CB, ADHD-IA, and Other Psychiatric groups all received mean scores in the clinical range on the Brown ADD Scale, with a trend toward even higher elevations in the two ADHD groups. Among 12 CPT variables assessed for the three groups, the mean scores on only two variables for the ADHD-IA group were clinically elevated. Neither the Brown ADD Scale nor CPT scores evinced sufficient sensitivity and specificity to qualify them to assist in differential diagnosis of ADHD vis-a-vis other, predominantly internalizing, psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a need for closer examination of executive and adaptive functioning in adults with ADHD compared with those with internalizing disorders in order to identify features that could assist in differential diagnosis.","tags":{"Accession Number":"15337862","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Sep","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","DOI":"10.1017\/s1092852900001929","Epub Date":"2004\/09\/01","ISSN":"1092-8529 (Print) 1092-8529","Issue":"9","Journal":"CNS Spectr","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis Diagnosis, Differential Humans *Self-Assessment *Surveys and Questionnaires","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"Solanto, Mary V Etefia, Kennett Marks, David J Journal Article United States CNS Spectr. 2004 Sep;9(9):649-59. doi: 10.1017\/s1092852900001929.","Pages":"649-59","Short Title":"The utility of self-report measures and the continuous performance test in the diagnosis of ADHD in adults","Type":"JOUR","Volume":"9","Year":"2004"},"attachments":["870_Solanto 2004.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"24298":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer7","key":"","data":[{"question":"issues","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"check for combination data"}},{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"The study examined the utility of self-report measures (Brown ADD Scale) and neuropsychological tools (Conners Continuous Performance Test) for diagnosing ADHD in adults","answer":"KQ1"}},{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"The study found differences in test scores between ADHD subtypes (ADHD-CB vs. ADHD-IA)","answer":"KQ1a"}},{"question":"ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Solanto, 2004{#870}"}},{"question":"trial_ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ID N\/A"}},{"question":"location","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"US"}},{"question":"sites","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"The study was conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, United States","answer":"Single center"}},{"question":"funding","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Unclear"}},{"question":"setting","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"Neuropsychological clinic within the Mount Sinai School of Medicine","answer":"Specialty care"}},{"question":"sample_size_explain","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ADHD combined (44);

With ADHD information readily accessible on the Internet, today's students are likely to be symptom educated prior to evaluation. This may result in false-positive diagnoses, particularly when students are motivated to convey symptoms. We evaluated the utility of ADHD symptom checklists, neurocognitive tests, and measures initially developed to detect feigned neurocognitive or psychiatric dysfunction (symptom validity tests [SVTs]). The performance of 31 undergraduates financially motivated and coached about ADHD via Internet-derived information was compared to that of 29 ADHD undergraduates following medication washout and 14 students not endorsing symptomatology. Results indicated malingerers readily produced ADHD-consistent profiles. Symptom checklists, including the ADHD Rating Scale and Conners's Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self-Rating Form: Long, were particularly susceptible to faking. Conners's Continuous Performance Test-II findings appeared more related to motivation than condition. Promising results were seen with all cognitive SVTs (Test of Memory Malingering [TOMM], Digit Memory Test, Letter Memory Test, and Nonverbal-Medical Symptom Validity Test), particularly TOMM Trial 1 when scored using Trial 2 criteria. All SVTs demonstrated very high specificity for the ADHD condition and moderate sensitivity to faking, which translated into high positive predictive values at rising base rates of feigning. Combining 2 or more failures resulted in only modest declines in sensitivity but robust specificity. Results point to the need for a thorough evaluation of history, cognitive and emotional functioning, and the consideration of exaggerated symptomatology in the diagnosis of ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"20528060","Author Address":"Department of Psychology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0044, USA.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jun","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:36","DOI":"10.1037\/a0018857","Epub Date":"2010\/06\/10","ISSN":"1040-3590","Issue":"2","Journal":"Psychol Assess","Keywords":"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/*psychology Cognition Disorders\/diagnosis *Deception Diagnosis, Differential Female Humans Kentucky Male Malingering\/*diagnosis\/psychology Motivation Neuropsychological Tests Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Students\/*psychology\/*statistics & numerical data Surveys and Questionnaires Young Adult","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1939-134x Sollman, Myriam J Ranseen, John D Berry, David T R Journal Article United States Psychol Assess. 2010 Jun;22(2):325-35. doi: 10.1037\/a0018857.","Pages":"325-35","Short Title":"Detection of feigned ADHD in college students","Type":"JOUR","Volume":"22","Year":"2010"},"attachments":["872_Sollman 2010.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"24299":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer7","key":"","data":[{"question":"issues","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"check whether feining vs diagnostic data"}},{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"The study compares the diagnostic accuracy of tools such as ADHD symptom checklists (CAARS, ARS), continuous performance tests (C-CPT), and symptom validity tests (TOMM, DMT) in identifying ADHD among adults, focusing on their ability to differentiate genuine ADHD from feigned cases","answer":"KQ1"}},{"question":"ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Sollman, 2010{#872}"}},{"question":"trial_ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ID N\/A"}},{"question":"location","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"US"}},{"question":"sites","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"University of Kentucky","answer":"Single center"}},{"question":"funding","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Unclear"}},{"question":"setting","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"University of Kentucky","answer":"School\/University"}},{"question":"size","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"73"}},{"question":"sample_size_explain","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"HON: 14;

Standalone performance validity tests (PVTs) have shown some success in identifying feigned ADHD, but these tests are rarely used in typical ADHD evaluation batteries. The present study attempted to develop embedded PVT indices from the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ-IV). College students (N\u2009=\u2009150) completed a battery including tasks from the WJ-IV, as well as an established standalone PVT and a rating scale measuring ADHD and related symptoms. Thirty of the students had been professionally diagnosed with ADHD; of the remaining 120 students, half were asked to perform honestly and to the best of their ability on the battery, whereas the other half were asked to try to simulate ADHD. Several processing speed and working memory scores from the WJ-IV effectively identified students feigning ADHD, detecting at least 50% of those students at score cutoffs that also maintained specificity of 90% or more, close to the efficiency of the standalone PVT. In addition, students with ADHD diagnoses generally did not show deficits on the WJ-IV. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.","tags":{"Accession Number":"32320323","Author Address":"State University of New York at Oswego, Oswego, NY, USA.

clinical utility of three visual attention tests to distinguish adults with ADHD from normal controls","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Adult patients with ADHD may go unrecognised and undiagnosed. This can result in psychosocial and functional decline. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical use of three objective computerised tests in the diagnosis of adult patients with ADHD. METHODS: Case-control study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: aged 18-65, ADHD diagnosis; exclusion criteria: visual impairments, colour vision deficiencies, acute mental illness, amnesia, and learning difficulties. ADHD was diagnosed with Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (n=14) and were matched for gender and age against normal controls (n=30). Three computer-based tasks, Stroop test, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity test were completed. Accuracy (%) and response time (ms) were measured. Generalized Estimating Equations method was used to analyse those repeated measurements data. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each test. RESULTS: Mean age of cases was 47.29 (SD 9.03), 9 males. Mean age of controls was 41.57 (SD 11.42), 13 males. Individuals with ADHD had significantly worse performances in both accuracy and response time in all the tests. The best discriminate ability was the Stroop test (accuracy and response time), followed by the Perceptual Selectivity test (response time). Comparisons of AUCs of the tests did not show any significant differences. Age had a significant effect on the Stroop and Stroop Plus tests but not in the Perceptual Selectivity test. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with ADHD have a longer response time and perform less accurately than controls. Thus, these data suggest that there is a use for objective visual attention tests in the diagnosis of adult ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"31657805","Author Address":"Sligo Mental Health Services, Clarion Rd, Sligo, Ireland.

The second screen consisted of the stimulus: one colour word at a pixel resolution of 85 was shown at the centre of the screen. Any of the four color words were shown randomly (red, green, blue, yellow). The font colour of the words were either congruent to the word itself or incongruent. The ratio of congruent to incongruent tasks was 1:3. Participants were asked to respond to the color of the word and not the word itself as fast as they could (for example, the word \u201cblue\u201d written in red letters). This task demanded the selection of relevant information (e.g. attention to the color of the ink) and ignoring the verbal content.\r\nStroop Plus Test: This test was designed similar to the Stroop test, however, it also included an inhibitory stimulus in the form of an arrow pointing to a colored box. The word stimulus was positioned at the centre of the screen with 4 colored boxes (red, green, blue, yellow) measuring 3 cm x 3 cm positioned at perpendicular angles 5cm from the word stimulus. An arrow measuring 3 cm pointed randomly at any of the colored boxes during each run and acted as an inhibitory stimulus. The congruent to incongruent ratio of the word stimulus was again 1:3 but when considering the congruency of all the stimuli (word, arrow and coloured box) it was 1:9. Participants were asked to respond to the font colour of the word and not the verbal content of the word as fast as they could by pressing the relevant key. While the Stroop test was used to measure selective attention, the arrow was used to measure intentional motor inhibition, also known as executive inhibition.\r\nPerceptual Selectivity Test: The Stroop test was presented at the centre of the screen. Four shapes with a radius of 1.5 cm were shown 5 cm from the word stimulus and were positioned perpendicularly to it. Three of the shapes were similar and one was different from the rest. The shapes could be either circles or squares. The colour font of the shapes were either all blue or all yellow in 50% of runs. In the other 50%, 3 were yellow and 1 blue and vice versa. In each of the shapes a line of 2.5 cm length was presented and was positioned at either -45 degrees , 0 degrees , 45 degrees or 90 degrees. In this test the participants were asked to respond to the orientation of the line in the odd shape by pressing the corresponding key and the hence colours were irrelevant. The orientation could be either horizontal or vertical. This test was used to measure a subtype of selective attention known as perceptual selectivity. This term refers to how discriminable a stimulus is: in other words, how effectively the participant can distinguish the goal task when presented with a single stimulus (change in shape only) and when faced with two stimuli (change in shape and the presence of an irrelevant colour)."}},{"question":"sensitivity_other_neuropsycho_tests","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Sensitivity is not available"}},{"question":"specificity_other_neuropsycho_tests","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Specificity is not available"}},{"question":"Other_AUC_neuropsycho_tests","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Stroop Test (accuracy): 0.814 (p=.001; 95% CI: .679, .949); Stroop Test (response time): .810 (p=.001; 95% CI: .664, .955); Stroop Plus Test (accuracy): .723 (p=.018; 95% CI: .569, .876); Stroop Plus Test (response time): .724 (p=.018; 95% CI: .563, .885); Perceptual Selectivity Test (accuracy): .707 (p=.028, 95% CI: .542, .872); Perceptual Selectivity Test (response time): .783 (p=.003; 95% CI: .643, .924)"}},{"question":"diagnostic_results_other","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"The study evaluated the clinical utility of three computerized neuropsychological tests\u2014Stroop, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity\u2014to distinguish adults with ADHD from controls.

However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria. OBJECTIVES: To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general population surveys (2001-2003 household survey [n\u2009=\u2009119] and 2004-2005 managed care subscriber survey [n\u2009=\u2009218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011-2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015-2016 primary care controls (n\u2009=\u2009300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS. RESULTS: Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples. Operating characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold in the weighted (to the 8.2% DSM-5\/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population prevalence) data (sensitivity, 91.4%; specificity, 96.0%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3%). Operating characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7%) when the scale was applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9%; specificity, 74.0%; AUC, 0.83; PPV, 82.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, detects the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also has high specificity and PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty treatment settings.","tags":{"Accession Number":"28384801","Author Address":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

OBJECTIVES: To test the performance of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale V 1.1(ASRS) for adult ADHD in an international sample of treatment seeking SUD patients for DSM-IV-TR; for the proposed DSM-5 criteria; in different subpopulations, at intake and 1-2 weeks after intake; using different scoring algorithms; and different externalizing disorders as external criterion (including adult ADHD, bipolar disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder). METHODS: In 1138 treatment seeking SUD subjects, ASRS performance was determined using diagnoses based on Conner's Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID) as gold standard. RESULTS: The prevalence of adult ADHD was 13.0% (95% CI: 11.0-15.0%). The overall positive predictive value (PPV) of the ASRS was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.22-0.30), the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98). The sensitivity (0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.88) and specificity (0.66, 95% CI: 0.63-0.69) measured at admission were similar to the sensitivity (0.88, 95% CI: 0.83-0.93) and specificity (0.67, 95% CI: 0.64-0.70) measured 2 weeks after admission. Sensitivity was similar, but specificity was significantly better in patients with alcohol compared to (illicit) drugs as the primary substance of abuse (0.76 vs. 0.56). ASRS was not a good screener for externalizing disorders other than ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The ASRS is a sensitive screener for identifying possible ADHD cases with very few missed cases among those screening negative in this population.","tags":{"Accession Number":"23660242","Author Address":"Trimbos-instituut and ICASA Foundation, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Amsterdam Institute for Addiction Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This study examined these variables using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS). METHOD: The sample included 349 adults evaluated for attention problems. Correlations and kappa values were calculated using self- and observer-ratings of item-level symptoms; sensitivity, specificity, and discriminant validity of cluster scores in predicting clinician diagnoses were computed for 269 participants. RESULTS: Item-level concordance rates ranged from slight to fair. Cluster scores demonstrated a poor balance of sensitivity and specificity in predicting ADHD diagnosis; a high percentage of participants with internalizing disorders had scores in the clinical range. CONCLUSION: Self-and observer- ratings on the CAARS provide clinically relevant data about attention problems in adults, but the instrument does not effectively distinguish between ADHD and other adult psychiatric disorders.","tags":{"Accession Number":"20424007","Author Address":"Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. e.vanv@duke.edu","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Apr","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:38","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:38","DOI":"10.1177\/1087054709356163","Epub Date":"2010\/04\/29","ISSN":"1087-0547 (Print) 1087-0547","Issue":"3","Journal":"J Atten Disord","Keywords":"Adolescent Adult Aged Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/psychology *Diagnostic Self Evaluation Emotions Female Humans Male Middle Aged Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Severity of Illness Index","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","NIHMSID":"NIHMS432446 and\/or consulting fees from the following sources: Shire Pharamceuticals, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Addrenex Pharmaceuticals, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, National Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences, and the Environmental Protection Agency.","Notes":"1557-1246 Van Voorhees, Elizabeth E Hardy, Kristina K Kollins, Scott H K24 DA023464\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States K24DA023464\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

We aim to describe the adult ADHD phenotype, to test the psychometric properties of the DSM-5 ADHD criteria, and to calculate the resulting prevalence in a population-based sample in their thirties. METHOD: A cross-sectional evaluation using the DSM-5 ADHD criteria was carried out in 3574 individuals from the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort. Through receiver operator curve, latent and regression analyses, we obtained parameters on construct and discriminant validity. Still, prevalence rates were calculated for different sets of criteria. RESULTS: The latent analysis suggested that the adult ADHD phenotype is constituted mainly by inattentive symptoms. Also, inattention symptoms were the symptoms most associated with impairment. The best cut-off for diagnosis was four symptoms, but sensitivity and specificity for this cut-off was low. ADHD prevalence rates were 2.1% for DSM-5 ADHD criteria and 5.8% for ADHD disregarding age-of-onset criterion. CONCLUSIONS: The bi-dimensional ADHD structure proposed by the DSM demonstrated both construct and discriminant validity problems when used in the adult population, since inattention is a much more relevant feature in the adult phenotype. The use of the DSM-5 criteria results in a higher prevalence of ADHD when compared to those obtained by DSM-IV, and prevalence would increase almost threefold when considering current ADHD syndrome. These findings suggest a need for further refinement of the criteria for its use in the adult population.","tags":{"Accession Number":"27866484","Author Address":"Department of Psychiatry,ADHD Out-patient Program, Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul,Porto Alegre,Brazil.

and identifying patients with ADHD based on the discriminative model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dataset of resting state fMRI contains 23 patients with ADHD and 23 healthy subjects were analyzed. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was extracted from resting state fMRI signals and used as model inputs. Raw ReHo features were ranked and selected in a loop according to their p values. Selected features were trained and tested by support vector machines (SVM) in a cross validation procedure. Cross validation was repeated in feature selection loop to produce optimized model. RESULTS: Optimized discriminative map indicated that the ADHD brains exhibit more increased activities than normal controls in bilateral occipital lobes and left front lobe. The altered brain regions included portions of basal ganglia, insula, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), thalamus, and cerebellum. Correlation coefficients indicated significant positive correlation of inattentive scores with bilateral cuneus and precuneus, and significant negative correlation of hyperactive\/impulsive scores with bilateral insula and claustrum. Additionally, the optimized model produced total accuracy of 80% and sensitivity of 87%. CONCLUSION: ADHD brain regions were more activated than normal controls during resting state. Linear support vector classifier can provide useful discriminative information of altered ReHo patterns for ADHD; and feature selection can improve the performances of classification.","tags":{"Accession Number":"23684384","Author Address":"School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Sep","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:38","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:38","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ejrad.2013.04.009","Epub Date":"2013\/05\/21","ISSN":"0720-048x","Issue":"9","Journal":"Eur J Radiol","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/*physiopathology Brain\/*physiopathology Brain Mapping\/*methods Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging\/*methods Male Nerve Net\/*physiopathology Pattern Recognition, Automated\/*methods Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity *Support Vector Machine Adhd Discriminative model Regional homogeneity Resting state fMRI","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"1872-7727 Wang, Xunheng Jiao, Yun Tang, Tianyu Wang, Hui Lu, Zuhong Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Ireland Eur J Radiol. 2013 Sep;82(9):1552-7. doi: 10.1016\/j.ejrad.2013.04.009.

METHOD: Color, form, and color-form combination naming tests were administered to 104 adults, ages 17-55 years, referred for psychiatric evaluation of possible ADHD. Thirty healthy adults were controls. Psychiatric intake procedures identified 64 adults with ADHD (ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria) and 40 with mild psychiatric disorders without ADHD. The study was conducted from 2008 through 2010. RESULTS: At intake, color, form, and color-form combination naming times (seconds) were longer and overhead [color-form combination - (color + form)] was larger for patients with ADHD than for non-ADHD patients and controls. In the ADHD group, color and form measures were in the normal range. Color-form combination was in the slower-than-normal speed (60-70 seconds) and overhead, a processing-efficiency measure, in the atypical range (> 10 seconds). In the non-ADHD patient and control groups, all AQT measures were in the normal range. Analysis of variance with post hoc analysis of log-normal values for color, form, and color-form combination and time for overhead indicated significant (Bonferroni P < .01) mean differences between the ADHD and other groups, but not between the non-ADHD and control groups. When using fail criteria for either color-form combination or overhead, the sensitivity for the ADHD group was 89%. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS support AQT as a possible complement to psychiatric intake procedures to differentiate adults with ADHD from those with mild psychiatric disorders, and they suggest that a controlled prospective study might be productive.","tags":{"Accession Number":"22943032","Author Address":"Communication Disorders, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts (Dr Wiig), and Department of Psychiatry, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (Dr Nielsen).","Database Provider":"NLM","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:39","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:39","DOI":"10.4088\/PCC.11m01273","Epub Date":"2012\/09\/04","ISSN":"2155-7772 (Print) 2155-7780","Issue":"2","Journal":"Prim Care Companion CNS Disord","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"2155-7780 Wiig, Elisabeth Hemmersam Nielsen, Niels Peter Journal Article United States Prim Care Companion CNS Disord. 2012;14(2):PCC.11m01273. doi: 10.4088\/PCC.11m01273.

Specifically, an intra-individual discrepancy analysis was implemented in which differences between intellectual functioning and performance on a battery of six frontal\/executive tests were examined within a homogeneous group of ADHD adults and matched normal controls. Significant group differences were identified between the ADHD adults and control sample on each of the dependent measures, with moderate diagnostic efficiency rates for the individual measures and a Discrepancy Impairment Index (DII). The discrepancy analysis approach generated significantly greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of ADHD as compared to a level of performance interpretive approach. Overall, these results provide support for the consideration of discrepancies between intellectual ability and frontal\/executive functioning for the assessment of adult ADHD.","tags":{"Accession Number":"14589720","Author Address":"The Virginia Consortium, Norfolk, VA, USA. spwoods@u.washington.edu","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"May","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:39","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:39","Epub Date":"2003\/11\/01","ISSN":"0887-6177 (Print) 0887-6177","Issue":"4","Journal":"Arch Clin Neuropsychol","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"Woods, Steven Paul Lovejoy, David W Stutts, Michael L Ball, J D Fals-Stewart, William Journal Article United States Arch Clin Neuropsychol. 2002 May;17(4):351-69.","Pages":"351-69","Short Title":"Comparative efficiency of a discrepancy analysis for the classification of Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder in adults","Type":"JOUR","Volume":"17","Year":"2002"},"attachments":["999_Woods 2002.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"14836":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer9","key":"","data":[{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"KQ1"}},{"question":"ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Woods, 2002{#999}"}},{"question":"trial_ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ID N\/A"}},{"question":"location","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"US"}},{"question":"sites","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Single center"}},{"question":"funding","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Unclear"}},{"question":"setting","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Specialty care"}},{"question":"size","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"52"}},{"question":"sample_size_explain","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"26 females and 26 males"}},{"question":"ADHDsample","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ADHD participants were recruited through their psychiatrists, met DSM-IV criteria, and were evaluated after a 12-hour medication break, and were excluded if they had other Axis I diagnoses, use of non-stimulant psychoactive medications, intellectual scores <85, substance abuse, neurological issues, learning disabilities, or ineffective response to stimulant medication"}},{"question":"participants_other","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Control group participants were included if they were matched to ADHD participants based on age and gender, with no more than three ADHD symptoms, no current or prior ADHD diagnosis, intellectual scores \u226585, and no history of substance abuse, no neurological disease, or head injury, or prior diagnosis or special education for a learning disability"}},{"question":"other_participant_category","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"Clinical"}},{"question":"percent_female","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"50"}},{"question":"age_mean_SD","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"38.38 (9.27)"}},{"question":"age_min","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"21"}},{"question":"age_max","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"55"}},{"question":"age_subgroup","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Mixed"}},{"question":"comorbidity_subgroup","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"other_info_race_ethnicity","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"presentation","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"index_test","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"","answer":"Feigning"}},{"question":"ML","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"No"}},{"question":"validation_dataset","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"N\/A"}},{"question":"reference_standard_type","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Clinical diagnosis"}},{"question":"reference_standard_description","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria by board certified psychiatrist"}},{"question":"Who performed the diagnosis?","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"Psychiatrist","answer":"Specialist (e.g., mental health)"}},{"question":"Timing of the outcome data","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Prior diagnosis"}},{"question":"test_description_feigningADHD","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"DII (Differential Impairment Index) assesses cognitive impairment by comparing test performance to an individual\u2019s estimated IQ.

The current diagnosis of ADHD primarily depends on the judgment of clinical symptoms, which highlights the need for objective imaging biomarkers. In this study, we aim to classify ADHD (both children and adults [34\/112]) from age-matched healthy controls (HCs [28\/77]) with functional connectivity (FCs) pattern derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. However, the neuroimaging classification of brain disorders often meets a situation of high dimensional features were presented with limited sample size. Thus an efficient method that is able to reduce original feature dimension into a much more refined subspace is highly desired. Here we proposed a novel Feature Selection method based on Relative Importance and Ensemble Learning (FS_RIEL). Compared with traditional feature selection methods, FS_RIEL algorithm improved the ADHD classification by about 15% in both child and adult ADHD classification, achieving 80-86% accuracy. Moreover, we found the most frequently selected FCs were mainly involved in frontoparietal network, default network, salience network, basal ganglia network and cerebellum network in both child and adult ADHD cohorts, which indicates that ADHD is characterized by a widely-impaired brain connectivity profile that may serve as potential biomarkers for its early diagnosis.","tags":{"Accession Number":"30441383","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jul","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:39","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-08-02 17:28:39","DOI":"10.1109\/embc.2018.8513155","Epub Date":"2018\/11\/18","ISSN":"2375-7477","Journal":"Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc","Keywords":"Adult Algorithms Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis Brain\/*diagnostic imaging *Brain Mapping Case-Control Studies Child *Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted Female Humans Machine Learning Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Young Adult","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed May 28 2024","Notes":"2694-0604 Yao, Dongren Guo, Xiaojie Zhao, Qihua Liu, Lu Cao, Qingjiu Wang, Yufeng D Calhoun, Vince Sun, Li Sui, Jing P20 GM103472\/GM\/NIGMS NIH HHS\/United States R01 EB006841\/EB\/NIBIB NIH HHS\/United States R01 EB005846\/EB\/NIBIB NIH HHS\/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2018 Jul;2018:4632-4635. doi: 10.1109\/EMBC.2018.8513155.","Pages":"4632-4635","Short Title":"Discriminating ADHD From Healthy Controls Using a Novel Feature Selection Method Based on Relative Importance and Ensemble Learning","Type":"JOUR","Volume":"2018","Year":"2018"},"attachments":["1011_Yao 2018.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"24305":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer7","key":"","data":[{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"The study does not evaluate or compare diagnostic tools commonly used in primary care or specialty care for ADHD, nor does it report adverse events;

An archival ADHD clinical group (n = 34), normal control group (n = 37), and group instructed to feign ADHD symptoms (n = 32) completed the MMPI-2 and ADHD Current and Childhood Symptoms Scales.

We designed a series of three studies to accomplish this aim. METHOD: Study One (n\u2009=\u2009155) and Study Two (n\u2009=\u2009591) collected data via surveys to conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, respectively. Study Three analyzed the scale's psychometrics in a clinical sample (n\u2009=\u2009151). RESULTS: Study One and Study Two identified a 10-item scale with a two-factor structure. Study Three found good discriminant validity, sensitivity\u2009=\u200980.0%, specificity\u2009=\u200980.2%, and convergent validity with both the Brown Executive Function\/Attention Scales, r (131)\u2009=\u2009.76, p\u2009<\u2009.001, and the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scales r (131)\u2009=\u2009.71, p\u2009<\u2009.001.

We explored the discrimination ability of a widely used ADHD screen, the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale (BAARS-IV), against a clinical diagnostic interview. A brief version of the screen was then developed in order to simplify its use in the prison context, and maximize its diagnostic properties. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of 390 male prison inmates was performed in the UK, all participants were screened and interviewed via the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults 2.0 (DIVA-2). RESULTS: A total of 47 (12.1%) inmates screened positive for ADHD using the full BAARS-IV, and 96 (24.6%) were clinically diagnosed, for a sensitivity of 37.9 and a specificity of 96.3. Our models identified the six items that most predicted ADHD diagnosis, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.66 to 4.58. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.82, 0.84 and 0.84, respectively, for the developed brief scale, and 0.71, 0.85 and 0.81 for its validation. Weighted probability scores produced an area under the curve of 0.89 for development, and 0.82 for validation of the brief scale. CONCLUSIONS: The original BAARS-IV performed poorly at identifying prison inmates with ADHD. Our developed brief scale substantially improved diagnostic accuracy. The brief screening instrument has great potential to be used as an accurate and resource-effective tool to screen young people and adults for likely ADHD in the criminal justice system.","tags":{"Accession Number":"26867860","Author Address":"Division of Brain Sciences,Department of Medicine,Centre for Mental Health,Imperial College,London,UK.

DESIGN: Participants were clinical referrals for assessment of ADHD in adulthood and healthy controls. METHOD: ADHD adults were compared with individuals with mild psychiatric disorders (including attention problems), a healthy control group on neuropsychological measures of attention (CPT and LCT) and on impulsivity (MFF). Secondly, the scores obtained on these measures were correlated with the Young ADHD Questionnaire-S (YAQ-S) and Young ADHD Questionnaire-I (YAQ-I) self- and informant-reported scales of ADHD symptomatology, emotional problems, delinquency, and social functioning. RESULTS: The ADHD group were more impaired than the healthy controls on neuropsychological measures, but only the MFF differentiated them from the psychiatric controls. Tests of attentional control positively correlated with the selfreported functioning of the ADHD group but not among the psychiatric or normal controls. There was a positive correlation between tests of attention (but not impulsivity) and self-ratings of ADHD symptomatology for the ADHD group, suggesting that ADHD adults are better at recognizing attentional problems than impulse control. A positive correlation was found between the Delinquency scale and a test of impulsivity for the ADHD group only. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there are neuropsychological underpinnings of the ADHD syndrome but neuropsychological tests may discriminate poorly between ADHD and mild psychiatric disorders.

The current study explored the utility of integrating an eye tracker with a commercially available continuous performance test (CPT), the MOXO-dCPT. As part of the study, the performance of adult attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and healthy controls (n = 43, n = 42, respectively) was compared in the integrated system. More specifically, the MOXO-dCPT has four stages, which differ in their combinations of ecological visual and auditory dynamic distractors. By exploring the participants' performance in each of the stages, we were able to show that: (a) ADHD patients spend significantly more time gazing at irrelevant areas of interest (AOIs) compared to healthy controls; (b) visual distractors are particularly effective in impacting ADHD patients' eye movements, suggesting their enhanced utility in diagnostic procedures; (c) combining gaze direction data and conventional CPT indices enhances group prediction, compared to the sole use of conventional indices. Overall, the findings indicate the utility of eye tracker-integrated CPTs and their enhanced diagnostic precision. They also suggest that the use of attention-grabbing visual distractors may be a promising path for the evolution of existing CPTs by shortening their duration and enhancing diagnostic precision.","tags":{"Accession Number":"33182303","Author Address":"Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Ariel University, Ariel 40700, Israel.

Few methods, however, exist to identify such feigning when it occurs. While some clinicians include computerized tests of attention (e.g., Test of Variables of Attention [TOVA]) when assessing for possible ADHD, it is unclear how symptom exaggerators perform, and whether the TOVA Symptom Exaggeration Index (SEI) adequately identifies performance-based exaggeration when it occurs. Using archival data from a university-based ADHD screening clinic we investigated the performance of 245 late adolescents\/emerging adults. Three groups were created: (1) Good effort but not ADHD (n\u2009=\u2009183); (2) Good effort and diagnosed ADHD (n\u2009=\u200913); and (3) suspect effort (n\u2009=\u200949), based on final diagnosis and performance on an existing validity measure. Results showed clearly that those with suspect effort performed more poorly than the other two groups on all but second-half commission errors on the TOVA. Similar to Nicholls et\u00a0al., the suspect effort group showed significantly subaverage (i.e., greater than two standard deviations below the mean) scores in Omission errors; in this replication, however, this was true for both the first and second half of the test. Response time variability was similarly exaggerated, with the suspect effort group again returning extreme scores in both halves of the test. Suspect effort students were indistinguishable from those with genuine ADHD when looking solely at self-reported symptoms; however, embedded symptom validity measures on an ADHD rating scale discriminated well between groups. Overall, results support the use of the TOVA as an embedded performance validity measure in the assessment of late adolescents\/emerging adults and support previous findings that symptom report alone cannot distinguish credible from noncredible ADHD presentation.","tags":{"Accession Number":"32301339","Author Address":"Regional Assessment and Resource Centre, Queens University, Kingston, Canada.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Oct-Dec","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:15","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:15","DOI":"10.1080\/21622965.2020.1750115","Epub Date":"2020\/04\/18","ISSN":"2162-2965","Issue":"4","Journal":"Appl Neuropsychol Child","Keywords":"Adolescent Attention\/*physiology Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/*psychology Female Humans Male Mass Screening\/methods\/*standards Neuropsychological Tests\/*standards Psychomotor Performance\/*physiology Reproducibility of Results Young Adult Adhd Tova diagnosis feigning validity","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed September 9 2024","Notes":"2162-2973 Harrison, Allyson G Armstrong, Irene T Comparative Study Journal Article United States Appl Neuropsychol Child. 2020 Oct-Dec;9(4):314-322. doi: 10.1080\/21622965.2020.1750115.

Assessment measures were administered to 55 (50%) female and 55 (50%) male adult (>18 yr. old) inpatients. Only six (5%) of the 110 inpatients had been diagnosed with comorbid ADHD according to medical charts. In contrast, 55 (50%) patients met criteria for ADHD according to the MINI, and 39 (36%) patients met criteria on the CAARS-S:SV. The higher rates of prevalence for the MINI and the CAARS-S:SV were attributable to symptom criteria for ADHD being similar to those shared with comorbid disorders.","tags":{"Accession

METHOD: Undergraduate students were assigned to a control or a simulated ADHD malingering condition and compared with a clinical AD\/HD group. The authors used several clinical attentional measures and symptom validity tests to differentiate experimental groups via a series of multivariate procedures. RESULTS: Simulators successfully feigned ADHD symptoms on a retrospective self-report measure. Moreover, knowledge of ADHD was unrelated to objective attentional measure performance. Overall, participants who simulated ADHD on some objective measures (i.e., specific Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III [WAIS-III] subtests) showed similar performance to the clinical ADHD comparison sample. CONCLUSION: The implications of these findings highlight the importance of relying on multiple vectors of information, be it objective, observational, self-report, or reports by others, when

Novel psychophysiological measures may enhance the data that is derived from CPTs and thereby improve clinical decision-making regarding diagnosis and treatment. As part of the current study, we integrated an eye tracker with the MOXO-dCPT and assessed the utility of eye movement measures to differentiate ADHD patients and healthy controls. METHOD: Adult ADHD patients and gender\/age-matched healthy controls performed the MOXO-dCPT while their eye movements were monitored (n = 33\u2009per group). RESULTS: ADHD patients spent significantly more time gazing at irrelevant regions, both on the screen and outside of it, than healthy controls. The eye movement measures showed adequate ability to classify ADHD patients. Moreover, a scale that combined eye movement measures enhanced group prediction, compared to the sole use of conventional MOXO-dCPT indices. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating an eye tracker with CPTs is a feasible way of enhancing diagnostic precision and shows initial promise for clarifying the cognitive profile of ADHD patients. Pending replication, these findings point toward a promising path for the evolution of existing CPTs.","tags":{"Accession Number":"33238787","Author Address":"Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.

However, because high-stakes decisions may be riding on the outcome of an ADHD evaluation (such as access to educational accommodations or stimulant medication), the diagnosis is vulnerable to exaggeration or feigning of symptoms or impairment. This study evaluates a novel procedure, the Tests of Attentional Distraction (TOAD), which is a computer-based performance validity measure involving a low difficulty continuous performance task that directly and obviously targets attentional function. A group of college student simulators (n\u2009=\u2009115) feigning ADHD were compared to 32 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 221 control participants on the TOAD, as well as on symptom validity indicators from the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Moderate to large effects differentiating the feigning group from control participants, both ADHD and non-ADHD, were observed for both the TOAD and PAI indicators. Incremental validity analyses indicated that the two approaches to validity assessment contributed independently to the detection of suspect responding.","tags":{"Accession Number":"29251998","Author Address":"a Department of Psychology , Texas A&M University , College Station , Texas , USA.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"May-Jun","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:17","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:17","DOI":"10.1080\/23279095.2017.1409749","Epub Date":"2017\/12\/19","ISSN":"2327-9095","Issue":"3","Journal":"Appl Neuropsychol Adult","Keywords":"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis Female Humans Male Malingering\/*diagnosis Neuropsychological Tests\/*standards Reproducibility of Results Young Adult Attention Deficit Disorder feigning performance validity symptom validity","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed September 9 2024","Notes":"2327-9109 Morey, Leslie C Journal Article United States Appl Neuropsychol Adult. 2019 May-Jun;26(3):255-267. doi: 10.1080\/23279095.2017.1409749.

Method: In a cross-sectional design, differences in self-report questionnaires and neuropsychological tests among clinical subgroups and healthy controls (HC) were evaluated. Patients in clinical groups were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) or ADHD with or without depressive symptoms according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) guidelines. Results: The Hyperactivity subscales of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) differed between MDD and ADHD, whereas self-concept and inattention scales even distinguished comorbidity subgroups within the ADHD population. A reduced alertness and higher variations in reaction times measured by performance tests indicated problems in sustained attention in ADHD patients compared with HC. Conclusion: The diagnostic process of ADHD, and thereby the distinction from other symptom-overlapping, comorbid mental disorders, might be improved by utilizing ADHD-specific self-report questionnaires and neuropsychological tests, which are short, cost-effective, and standardized screening methods.","tags":{"Accession Number":"31409195","Author Address":"University of Leipzig, Germany.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"May","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:17","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:17","DOI":"10.1177\/1087054719865780","Epub Date":"2019\/08\/15","ISSN":"1087-0547","Issue":"7","Journal":"J Atten Disord","Keywords":"Adult *Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/diagnosis\/epidemiology Cognition Cross-Sectional Studies Depression *Depressive Disorder, Major\/diagnosis\/epidemiology Humans Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Adhd neurocognitive measures","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed September 9 2024","Notes":"1557-1246 Paucke, Madlen Stibbe, Tina Huang, Jue Strauss, Maria Journal Article United States J Atten Disord. 2021 May;25(7):920-932. doi: 10.1177\/1087054719865780.

Rather than rely on face-valid (easily faked) ADHD checklists, the study focused on the more complex Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008). However, the current literature has not yet investigated well-defined detection strategies for feigned WAIS-IV presentations. Using aprioristic standards, four different detection strategies from the feigning literature were adapted to certain WAIS-IV subscales. For example, significantly below-chance performance was applied to visual puzzles. Using a between-subjects simulation design, 74 undergraduate simulators were compared with archival data on 73 outpatients diagnosed with ADHD at a university psychology clinic. Very large effect sizes (Cohen's ds from 1.66 to 1.90) differentiated between genuine and feigned ADHD. Two strategies (significantly below-chance performance and floor effect) showed strong promise if cross-validated for other feigning presentations. The study concluded with clinical considerations and future avenues for research.","tags":{"Accession Number":"32495690","Author Address":"University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA.","Database Provider":"NLM","Date":"Jan","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:17","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:17","DOI":"10.1177\/1073191120927788","Epub Date":"2020\/06\/05","ISSN":"1073-1911","Issue":"1","Journal":"Assessment","Keywords":"Adult *Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/diagnosis *Cognitive Dysfunction Humans Malingering\/diagnosis Neuropsychological Tests Reproducibility of Results Rds Wais-iv detection strategies feigned ADHD feigning floor effect significantly below-chance performance","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed September 9 2024","Notes":"1552-3489 Rogers, Richard Orcid: 0000-0002-4208-966x Velsor, Sarah F Donnelly, John W 2nd Dean, Brittney Journal Article United States Assessment. 2021 Jan;28(1):44-56. doi: 10.1177\/1073191120927788.

In response, several studies have validated tests for use in differentiating feigned from genuine ADHD. Although results have generally been positive, relatively few publications have addressed the possible impact of the presence of psychological disorders comorbid with ADHD. Because ADHD is thought to have accompanying conditions at rates of 50% and higher, it is important to determine if the additional psychological disorders might compromise the accuracy of feigning detection measures. The present study extended the findings of Jasinski et al. (2011) to examine the efficacy of various measures in the context of feigned versus genuine ADHD with comorbid psychological disorders in undergraduate students. Two clinical groups (ADHD only and ADHD + comorbid psychological disorder) were contrasted with two non-clinical groups (normal controls answering honestly and normal participants feigning ADHD). Extending previous research to individuals with ADHD and either an anxiety or learning disorder, performance validity tests such as the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), the Letter Memory Test (LMT), and the Nonverbal Medical Symptom Validity Test (NV-MSVT) were effective in differentiating both ADHD groups from normal participants feigning ADHD. However, the Digit Memory Test (DMT) underperformed in this study, as did embedded validity indices from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) and Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement-III (WJ-III).","tags":{"Accession Number":"25225947","Author Address":"a Department of Psychology , University of Kentucky , Lexington , KY 40506 , USA.","Database Provider":"NLM","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:18","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-09-15 04:19:18","DOI":"10.1080\/13854046.2014.956674","Epub Date":"2014\/09\/17","ISSN":"1385-4046","Issue":"7","Journal":"Clin Neuropsychol","Keywords":"Adolescent Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity\/*diagnosis\/*psychology Comorbidity Diagnosis, Differential Female Humans Intelligence Tests Male Malingering\/*diagnosis\/psychology *Memory *Neuropsychological Tests Reproducibility of Results Self Report Students\/*psychology\/*statistics & numerical data *Task Performance and Analysis Universities Wechsler Scales Young Adult Adhd Malingering Performance validity tests.","Language":"eng","Legal Note":"Pubmed September 9 2024","Notes":"1744-4144 Williamson, Kimberly D Combs, Hannah L Berry, David T R Harp, Jordan P Mason, Lisa H Edmundson, Maryanne Journal Article England Clin Neuropsychol. 2014;28(7):1182-96. doi: 10.1080\/13854046.2014.956674.

However, the current diagnostic process exhibits limitations that can significantly affect its overall effectiveness. Notably, its face-to-face and time-consuming nature, coupled with the reliance on subjective recall of historical information and clinician subjectivity, stand out as key challenges. To address these limitations, objective measures such as neuropsychological evaluations, imaging techniques and physiological monitoring of the Autonomic Nervous System functioning, have been explored. Methods: The main aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological data (i.e., Electrodermal Activity, Heart Rate Variability, and Skin Temperature) can serve as meaningful indicators of ADHD, evaluating its utility in distinguishing adult ADHD patients. This observational, case-control study included a total of 76 adult participants (32 ADHD patients and 44 healthy controls) who underwent a series of Stroop tests, while their physiological data was passively collected using a multi-sensor wearable device. Univariate feature analysis was employed to identify the tests that triggered significant signal responses, while the Informative k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used to filter out less informative data points. Finally, a machine-learning decision pipeline incorporating various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), was utilized for ADHD patient detection. Results: Results indicate that the SVM-based model yielded the optimal performance, achieving 81.6% accuracy, maintaining a balance between the experimental and control groups, with sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and 81.9%, respectively. Additionally, integration of data from all physiological signals yielded the best results, suggesting that each modality captures unique aspects of ADHD. Conclusions: This study underscores the potential of physiological signals as valuable diagnostic indicators of adult ADHD. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, our findings demonstrate that multimodal physiological data collected via wearable devices can complement traditional diagnostic approaches. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical applications and long-term implications of utilizing physiological markers in ADHD diagnosis and management.","tags":{"Author Address":"D.

It is considered as an important public health issue, and prevalence of diagnosis has increased as awareness of the disease grew over the past years. Supply of specialist medical experts has not kept pace with the increasing demand for assessment, both due to financial pressures on health systems and the difficulty to train new experts, resulting in growing waiting lists. Patients are not being treated quickly enough causing problems in other areas of health systems (e.g. increased GP visits, increased risk of self-harm and accidents) and more broadly (e.g. time off work, relationship problems). Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to diagnose ADHD based on the analysis of relevant data, and this could inform clinical practice. This paper reports on findings related to the mental health services of a specialist Trust within the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS). The analysis studied data of adult patients who underwent diagnosis over the past few years, and developed a diagnostic model for ADHD in adults.

EFT performance of 51 adults with ADHD was compared to the performance o 52 matched healthy individuals, as well as to 268 undergraduate students who were randoml allocated in a simulation design to one of four experimental conditions, i.e. a contro group, a na\u00efve simulation group, a symptom-coached simulation group or a test-coache simulation group. Furthermore, an independent sample of 11 adults with ADHD as well as sample of 17 clinicians experienced in the work with adults with ADHD were assessed fo further validation of the EFT Result The EFT was relatively easy to perform for both patients with ADHD and healthy comparison as shown by low error rates and non-significant group differences. However, simulatio groups differed from patients with ADHD by significant and large effects. An EFT inde for the prediction of feigned ADHD was derived based on logistic regression coefficients Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) demonstrated good classification accuracy o feigned ADHD relative to ADHD (AUC = 94.8%), i.e. high sensitivity (88%) and specificit (90%) ConclusionsThis study supports the utility of the EFT for the detection of feigned adult ADHD.","tags":{"Database":"Embase Medline","distiller_reference_created_date":"2024-10-16 22:28:17","distiller_reference_upload_date":"2024-10-16 22:28:17","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0164297","ISSN":"1932-6203","Issue":"10","Journal":"PLoS ONE","Keywords":"adult adulthood article attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controlled study diagnostic accuracy diagnostic test accuracy study disease classification embedded figures test female human instrument validation logistic regression analysis major clinical study male neuropsychological assessment patient assessment prediction predictive value receiver operating characteristic sensitivity and specificity simulation","Language":"English","Legal Note":"EMBASE October 14 2024","Notes":"L612656059 2016-10-24 2016-11-03","Short Title":"The development of an embedded figures test for the detection of feigned attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adulthood","Type":"JOUR","Type of Work":"Article","URL":"https:\/\/www.embase.com\/search\/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L612656059&from=export http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0164297","Volume":"11","Year":"2016"},"attachments":["5208-Fuermaier-2016.pdf"],"biblio_string":"","data_sets":{"24316":{"form":"Diagnosis data abstraction form","level":3,"is_subform":0,"user":"EPCReviewer7","key":"","data":[{"question":"KQ","type":"Checkbox","response":{"text":"The Embedded Figures Test (EFT) developed in the study demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing between genuine ADHD and feigned ADHD","answer":"KQ1"}},{"question":"ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Fuermaier, 2016{#5208}"}},{"question":"trial_ID","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"ID N\/A"}},{"question":"location","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Germany"}},{"question":"sites","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"","answer":"Single center"}},{"question":"funding","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"No specific funding","answer":"Other"}},{"question":"setting","type":"Radio","response":{"text":"Patients with ADHD were referred from psychiatrists and neurologists at the SRH Clinic Karlsbad-Langensteinbach, Germany; Healthy participants were psychology students from the University of Groningen, Netherlands\u200b","answer":"Setting varies"}},{"question":"size","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"329"}},{"question":"ADHDsample","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"Adults diagnosed with ADHD referred by psychiatrists or neurologists to the SRH Clinic Karlsbad-Langensteinbach, Germany, meeting DSM-IV criteria confirmed by psychiatric interviews, scoring above cutoff on standardized self-report scales, and demonstrating objective impairments and multiple informant support for diagnosis"}},{"question":"participants_other","type":"Text","response":{"answer":"","text":"The non-ADHD participants were recruited through public announcements and word-of-mouth.

Participants were 120 patients assessed for dysfunctional anger and impulsive aggression at a hospital-based clinic. Two psychiatrists made independent diagnoses about the presence or absence of ADHD among individuals presenting with symptoms consistent with this disorder. Following the diagnoses, participants were assessed with multiple ADHD measures, including measures based on self-report, observer-report, or a computerized neuropsychological measure (IVA + Plus). With the exception of the IVA + Plus, the ADHD measures significantly differentiated individuals diagnosed with ADHD from individuals who were not so diagnosed. These measures also demonstrated good diagnostic utility via test specific parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, and negative predictive power). A sub-set of measures demonstrated particularly good classification accuracy, with high sensitivity (91 %) and good specificity (81 %). Implications of these findings for the effective assessment and diagnosis of ADHD in adult outpatient psychiatric settings are discussed. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","tags":{"Author Address":"D.A.

Six independent criterion performance validity tests (PVTs) were used to establish valid (n = 280) and invalid (n = 37) performance groups. Among the valid group, 229 met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition criteria for ADHD. Non-significant to small correlations emerged between ES, FC, RD, and the criterion PVTs, suggesting these measures are largely independent. The valid group performed significantly better than the invalid group across all three embedded PVTs, with medium to large effects (d = 0.66\u20130.89). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses similarly revealed that all three PVTs accurately differentiated valid from invalid performance (areas under the curve: .63\u2013.74) with the following optimal cut-scores: ES \u2264 12 (43% sensitivity\/90% specificity), FC \u2264 14 (49% sensitivity\/92% specificity), RD \u2264 5 (35% sensitivity\/90% specificity). Results were identical between the overall sample of adult ADHD referrals and the subsample who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. In sum, these memory-based RAVLT and BVMT-R PVTs were able to accurately identify invalid neuropsychological test performance among adults undergoing evaluation for ADHD, regardless of whether diagnostic criteria for ADHD was met. Although optimal cut-scores generally were consistent with prior literature, sensitivity was generally less robust than prior cross-validation studies with mixed clinical and medicolegal samples.

In this study, we investigate if a distinct pattern of neuromuscular dysregulation previously reported in ADHD, can help identifying ADHD in psychiatric patients with diverse and complex symptoms. METHOD: We explored the impact of neuromuscular dysregulation, as measured by The Motor Function Neurologic Assessment (MFNU), on the likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD, affective disorder, anxiety disorder, or personality disorder among adults (n = 115) referred to a psychiatric outpatient clinic. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that neuromuscular dysregulation was significantly associated with ADHD diagnosis only (OR 1.15, p < .01), and not with affective-, anxiety-, or personality disorders. Sensitivity and specificity for ADHD at different MFNU scores is provided. CONCLUSIONS: A test of neuromuscular dysregulation may promote diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ADHD from other psychiatric disorders in patients with an overlapping symptom picture. This may have important implications for clinical practice.
