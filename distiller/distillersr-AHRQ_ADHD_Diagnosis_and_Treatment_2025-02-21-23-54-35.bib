              performance validity test (PVT) in an adult
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) clinical population
              and examined the effect of ADHD subtype and psychiatric comorbidity
              on accuracy for detecting invalidity. DCT performance was assessed
              among 210 consecutive adult ADHD referrals who underwent
              neuropsychological evaluation and were classified into valid (n =
              175) or invalid (n = 35) groups based on seven independent
              criterion PVTs. The invalid group had significantly worse DCT
              performance than the valid group using both the standard and
              unrounded scoring procedure (ηp2 = .28). Classification accuracy
              was excellent, with 54.3% sensitivity/92% specificity at optimal
              cut-scores of ≥14 (rounded) and ≥13.38 (unrounded). Nonsignificant
              DCT performance differences emerged based on ADHD subtype or the
              presence/absence of comorbid psychopathology. The DCT functions
              well as a nonmemory-based PVT in an ethnoracially diverse ADHD
              population, supporting its clinical utility for detecting invalid
              neurocognitive performance during ADHD evaluations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Continuous performance tests are widely used to aid
              diagnostic decision making and measure symptom reduction in adult
              ADHD clinical populations. The diagnostic accuracy of the
              Quantified Behavior Test plus (QbTest+), developed to identify ADHD
              populations as an objective measure of ADHD symptoms, was explored.
              METHODS: The utility of the QbTest+ was investigated in a clinical
              cohort of 69 adult patients referred to a specialist ADHD clinic in
              the UK. RESULTS: Scores from the QbTest+ failed to differentiate
              between patients diagnosed with ADHD and those who did not receive
              a diagnosis after full clinical assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on
              our findings, we recommend clinicians are cautious when
              interpreting results of the QbTest+ in clinical populations. This
              study highlights the need for investigation into the lack of
              validation of commonly used objective measures in ADHD populations.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The high potential for secondary gain among college
              students presenting for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
              (ADHD) evaluations highlights the need for psychometrically sound
              embedded validity indicators. The purpose of this study was to
              develop new validity indicators specific to feigned ADHD for the
              Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and compare them to
              preexisting imbedded PAI validity measures. METHOD: PAI scales that
              were theoretically related to feigned ADHD were evaluated. A
              binomial (ADHD simulators, n = 138, and genuine ADHD, n = 142)
              logistic regression was conducted with selected PAI scales and
              subscales. Classification rates were compared between the new and
              existing validity scales. A similar approach was used for
              item-level data in a second study in a subgroup of the original
              sample. RESULTS: The derived PAI scale-based logistic regression
              had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 92%. This algorithm
              accurately identified 97% of healthy controls as not feigning ADHD
              and correctly identified 98% of a no diagnosis group and 75% of a
              mood/anxiety disorders group. Classification accuracy of the new
              index was superior to the majority of existing PAI validity scales
              across groups. An item-level PAI algorithm had a sensitivity of 85%
              and specificity of 97% for identifying feigned ADHD. CONCLUSIONS:
              New validity measures were compared to existing PAI validity
              indicators and performed better than many of them in this study.
              The algorithms developed in this study of ADHD simulators and
              genuine ADHD cases have adequate sensitivity and good specificity
              and appear to function differently than other PAI symptom validity
              scales.},

  abstract = {Background: The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity
              disorder (ADHD) relies on history and observation, as no reliable
              biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we compared a large
              single diagnosis group of patients with ADHD (combined, inattentive
              , and hyperactive) to healthy controls using brain perfusion
              single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to
              determine specific brain regions which could serve as potential
              biomarkers to reliably distinguish ADHD. Methods: In a
              retrospective analysis, subjects (n = 1,135) were obtained from a
              large multisite psychiatric database, where resting state
              (baseline) and on-task SPECT scans were obtained. Only baseline
              scans were analyzed in the present study. Subjects were separated
              into two groups - Group 1 (n = 1,006) was composed of patients who
              only met criteria for ADHD with no comorbid diagnoses, while a
              control group (n = 129) composed of individuals who did not meet
              criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis, brain injury, or substance
              use served as a non-matched control. SPECT regions of interests
              (ROIs) and visual readings were analyzed using binary logistic
              regression. Predicted probabilities from this analysis were
              inputted into a Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis to
              identify sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: The
              baseline ROIs and visual readings show significant separations from
              healthy controls. Sensitivity of the visual reads was 100% while
              specificity was >97%. The sensitivity and specificity of the
              post-hoc ROI analysis were both 100%. Decreased perfusion was
              primarily seen in the orbitofrontal cortices, anterior cingulate
              gyri, areas of the prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, and temporal
              lobes. In addition, ROI analysis revealed some unexpected areas
              with predictive value in distinguishing ADHD, such as cerebellar
              subregions and portions of the temporal lobes. Conclusions: Brain
              perfusion SPECT distinguishes adult ADHD patients without
              comorbidities from healthy controls. Areas which were highly
              significantly different from control and thus may serve as
              biomarkers in baseline SPECT scans included: medial anterior
              prefrontal cortex, left anterior temporal lobe, and right insular
              cortex. Future studies of these potential biomarkers in ADHD
              patients with comorbidities are warranted.},

           disorder with multimodal physiological data: a case-control study},

  abstract = {Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a
              multifaceted neurodevelopmental psychiatric condition that
              typically emerges during childhood but often persists into
              adulthood, significantly impacting individuals' functioning,
              relationships, productivity, and overall quality of life. However,
              the current diagnostic process exhibits limitations that can
              significantly affect its overall effectiveness. Notably, its
              face-to-face and time-consuming nature, coupled with the reliance
              on subjective recall of historical information and clinician
              subjectivity, stand out as key challenges. To address these
              limitations, objective measures such as neuropsychological
              evaluations, imaging techniques and physiological monitoring of the
              Autonomic Nervous System functioning, have been explored. Methods:
              The main aim of this study was to investigate whether physiological
              data (i.e., Electrodermal Activity, Heart Rate Variability, and
              Skin Temperature) can serve as meaningful indicators of ADHD,
              evaluating its utility in distinguishing adult ADHD patients. This
              observational, case-control study included a total of 76 adult
              participants (32 ADHD patients and 44 healthy controls) who
              underwent a series of Stroop tests, while their physiological data
              was passively collected using a multi-sensor wearable device.
              Univariate feature analysis was employed to identify the tests that
              triggered significant signal responses, while the Informative
              k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used to filter out less
              informative data points. Finally, a machine-learning decision
              pipeline incorporating various classification algorithms, including
              Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forests, and Support Vector
              Machines (SVM), was utilized for ADHD patient detection. Results:
              Results indicate that the SVM-based model yielded the optimal
              performance, achieving 81.6% accuracy, maintaining a balance
              between the experimental and control groups, with sensitivity and
              specificity of 81.4% and 81.9%, respectively. Additionally,
              integration of data from all physiological signals yielded the best
              results, suggesting that each modality captures unique aspects of
              ADHD. Conclusions: This study underscores the potential of
              physiological signals as valuable diagnostic indicators of adult
              ADHD. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, our
              findings demonstrate that multimodal physiological data collected
              via wearable devices can complement traditional diagnostic
              approaches. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical
              applications and long-term implications of utilizing physiological
              markers in ADHD diagnosis and management.},
