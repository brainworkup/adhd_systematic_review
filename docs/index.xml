  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults presents
  a significant challenge in clinical practice due to its complex
  presentation, high comorbidity, and the varying responses to
  treatment. Clinicians, patients, and stakeholders must navigate
  several decisional dilemmas when diagnosing and treating ADHD in
  adults. Here, we address the key decisional dilemmas and current
  controversies and challenges in diagnosing ADHD in adults.</p>
  <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
  neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of
  inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. While it is commonly
  diagnosed in children, ADHD frequently persists into adulthood,
  presenting unique challenges for diagnosis and management. This
  section explores the key decisional dilemmas faced by clinicians,
  patients, and stakeholders in diagnosing and treating adult ADHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="background">
  <title>Background</title>
  <sec id="trajectory-of-adhd-across-development">
    <title>Trajectory of ADHD across development</title>
    <p>ADHD typically presents early in life, most often diagnosed and
    treated between early childhood and adolescence. Less commonly, ADHD
    can insidiously emerge in adulthood in individuals with no history
    of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity in childhood. Notably,
    longitudinal data from the MTA ADHD Treatment Study suggests 90-95%
    of “adult-onset ADHD” is better accounted for by comorbid
    psychopathology, personality disorders, and/or substance use
    disorders <italic>misdiagnosed</italic> as ADHD
    (<xref alt="sibley2017?" rid="ref-sibley2017" ref-type="bibr"><bold>sibley2017?</bold></xref>).
    The later-onset expression of ADHD thus appears to be a syndrome
    distinct from childhood-onset ADHD.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="executive-dysfunction-in-emerging-adulthood">
    <title>Executive dysfunction in emerging adulthood</title>
    <p>Seeking evaluation and treatment for ADHD <italic>for the first
    time</italic> continues to increase, and is especially salient on
    college campuses, where the use/misuse of prescription stimulant
    medication as a cognitive-enhancing drug is rising faster than the
    actual incidence of the disorder
    (<xref alt="benson2015?" rid="ref-benson2015" ref-type="bibr"><bold>benson2015?</bold></xref>).
    The volume of college students seeking an evaluation for ADHD to
    obtain test-taking and other academic accommodations has increased
    in parallel.</p>
    <p>Critically, interconnected heteromodal networks of association
    cortex that control higher executive cognitive functions are still
    maturing during college
    (<xref alt="sydnorNeurodevelopmentAssociationCortices2021?" rid="ref-sydnorNeurodevelopmentAssociationCortices2021" ref-type="bibr"><bold>sydnorNeurodevelopmentAssociationCortices2021?</bold></xref>).
    It is therefore plausible that generalized <italic>executive
    dysfunction</italic>, not undiagnosed ADHD per se, is underlying
    most clinical referrals for ADHD in college students. As such, we
    posit executive dysfunction is at the core of the real-world
    problems facing college students who self-refer for ADHD evaluation
    and treatment, which accentuates the comorbid difficulties these
    students face such as problematic drug and alcohol use, emotional
    dysregulation, and school failure.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="limited-diagnostic-tools-to-assess-adhd-and-executive-functioning-in-college-students">
    <title>Limited diagnostic tools to assess ADHD and executive
    functioning in college students</title>
    <p>Independent of when symptoms first present, the proliferation of
    adult-onset ADHD, whether real or feigned, signifies an increase in
    the demand to evaluate and treat ADHD across the lifespan. However,
    <italic>clinicians do not have evidence-based, objective
    psychodiagnostic tools</italic> (e.g., rating scales,
    neuropsychological measures) available to evaluate ADHD/EF in this
    specific population <italic>that grows each year</italic>. Poor
    diagnostic tools lead to inaccurate and misleading conclusions,
    which can result in clinicians making wasteful/cost-ineffective,
    inappropriate, or potentially even harmful treatment
    recommendations. If we fail to implement clinical assessment tools
    sensitive to <italic>symptom validity</italic> and
    <italic>performance validity</italic> during evaluations, we will
    continue to <italic>overdiagnose</italic> and treat college students
    and adults from the community faking ADHD for secondary gain, and
    <italic>underdiagnose</italic> those with actual ADHD who need
    medical and/or academic intervention.</p>

    <p>ADHD remains improperly diagnosed and treated in tens of
    thousands of promising college students, younger adults, and older
    adults. The consequences of aberrant diagnosis and treatment of ADHD
    during this critical stage of emerging adulthood and beyond can lead
    to functional impairments in school/work performance, educational
    attainment, career development, social-emotional development, and
    family and community life. The need for evidence-based diagnostic
    tools specific to this rapidly growing clinical population is
    urgently stronger than ever.</p>

  <title>Controversies and Challenges</title>
  <p>Diagnosing ADHD in adults is inherently challenging. Symptoms such
  as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity often overlap with
  other psychiatric conditions, making differential diagnosis difficult.
  Clinicians must consider the chronicity of symptoms from childhood
  through adulthood and assess functional impairment in various settings
  (<xref alt="culpepper2008?" rid="ref-culpepper2008" ref-type="bibr"><bold>culpepper2008?</bold></xref>).</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Different Practices</bold>: There is significant
      variability in diagnostic practices. While some clinicians use
      structured diagnostic interviews and validated rating scales,
      others rely on clinical judgment. This inconsistency can lead to
      both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis of ADHD

      <p><bold>Diagnostic Criteria</bold>: There is debate over whether

    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Overdiagnosis vs. Underdiagnosis</bold>: Controversy
      exists over the extent to which ADHD is overdiagnosed or
      underdiagnosed in adult populations

    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Gender Differences</bold>: The diagnosis of ADHD in women
      may be underrepresented due to differences in symptom presentation
      and societal expectations

    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Diagnostic Criteria and Symptom Manifestation</bold>:
      Adult ADHD diagnosis is complicated by the persistence and
      transformation of symptoms from childhood. Symptoms such as
      inattention and impulsivity may persist, while hyperactivity may
      manifest differently in adults.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Diagnostic Criteria Adaptation</bold>: Current diagnostic
      criteria (e.g., DSM-5) are based primarily on childhood symptoms,
      which may not fully capture adult presentations. There is a need
      for criteria that reflect adult-specific symptoms and
      impairments.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The accurate diagnosis of ADHD in adults presents several
