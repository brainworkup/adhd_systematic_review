# Diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults: A Systematic Review

## Abstract

**Objectives.** Different diagnostic tests to diagnose
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults have been
suggested. The review synthesizes the results of evaluations for
available diagnostic tools.

**Review methods.** Following a detailed published protocol and informed
by a technical expert panel, we reviewed the evidence for diagnostic
tools. We searched multiple sources to identify evaluations of tools
used for the diagnosis of ADHD in adults. Registration CRD42025638106.

**Results.** We identified [114]{.mark} diagnostic studies. Studies
evaluated self report questionnaires, peer review questionnaires,
neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalogram, diverse
biomarkers, clinician tools, combinations of modalities, and tools to
identify feigning ADHD.

**Conclusions.** XXX

### 1.  []{#_Toc178627495 .anchor}Introduction

#### 1.  []{#_Toc178627496 .anchor}Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by
persistent symptoms in the domains of inattention, hyperactivity, and
impulsivity.^1^ Clinically significant symptoms, especially inattention,
persist into adulthood in most individuals.^1-5^ The lifetime prevalence
of ADHD is approximately 5.3%,^6^ although epidemiological studies that
have not required a childhood onset have suggested that its prevalence
in adults may be as high as 6.7%.^7-10^ Although many adults with ADHD
adopt lifestyles that help compensate for their symptoms, they often
need to exert excess energy to overcome impairments. They are often
distressed by their inability to realize their full potential and by
persistent symptoms of restlessness, erratic moods, and poor
self-esteem.^11,\ 12^ Impaired productivity because of poor time
management, procrastination, and distractibility can limit work
productivity and lower overall quality of life.^11^ The mainstay of
treatments for ADHD in adults are U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved medications, especially stimulant medications. More than
2% of US adults misuse stimulant medications, mostly to aid
concentration and alertness,^13^ but also as a form of substance abuse.
A wide range of other treatments have been developed and may be
effective, including psychotherapy, psychosocial interventions,
cognitive training, neurofeedback, neuromodulation, and nutritional
supplements. Even when ADHD treatments prove helpful, however, long-term
adherence is often poor.^14-17^ Whether treatments that improve the core
symptoms also improve any problems associated with ADHD is unclear, and
the long-term effectiveness in adults is generally unknown.

ADHD is most often first diagnosed in elementary or middle school age
years or, less commonly, in high school or college when experiencing
difficulty meeting academic demands. It can also be first diagnosed in
adulthood, when impairments in attention, organization, and impulsivity
produce recurrent problems with occupational, social, or family
functioning. Adult diagnosis is often difficult because the outward
manifestations most readily evident to others, hyperactivity and
impulsivity, often improve during adolescence and no longer meet
diagnostic criteria.^18^ The symptoms of inattention (e.g., easy
distractibility, poor organization, being "spacey," avoiding and trouble
completing tasks that require sustained attention, losing things,
forgetfulness) are more subtle and may not reach the level of obvious
functional impairment until adulthood, within an occupational setting or
a marriage.

The diagnosis of ADHD in adults, as in childhood, is complicated by the
overlap of symptoms with other disorders.^19,\ 20^ Attention and
concentration, for example, can be impaired in persons who have
depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis, post-traumatic stress
disorder, or substance abuse. Hyperactivity can be confused with
anxiety-related behaviors and the excessive movements of tic and
obsessive-compulsive disorders. Impulsivity is often prominent in
bipolar and substance use disorders. The accurate diagnosis of adult
ADHD is further complicated by a substantial and growing number of
individuals, especially college students^21^ and highly driven working
professionals, who seek stimulant medications to aid cognitive
performance. Stimulants have long been known to improve sustained
attention and reduce distractibility in healthy individuals who do not
have ADHD,^22-26^ prompting some success-oriented individuals to feign
symptoms to their doctors or on neuropsychological test assessments.
Claims of exceptional diagnostic performance of these tools, the
differing measures of performance, and the differing performance
characteristics of different versions of a given tool,^27^ are
controversial and often confusing to clinicians, patients, and other
stakeholders. In addition, whether the performance of diagnostic tools
varies with the characteristics of the ADHD participants or comparator
sample is unknown.^28^ These diagnostic challenges can complicate the
accurate and reliable diagnosis of adult ADHD even for experienced
mental health clinicians.

Despite established diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5),
diagnosing ADHD in adults remains challenging due to the frequent
absence of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms, the subtlety of
inattention symptoms, the inaccuracy of recall in adults for their
retrospective assessments of ADHD symptoms in childhood (required to
meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria), and the common overlap with other
mental health conditions.^18,\ 19,\ 29^ The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria,
developed primarily for children, may not be suitable for adult
diagnosis, and the requirement of symptoms beginning before age 12 has
been debated.^30-34^ Furthermore, the accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD
is complicated by the large number of individuals,^21-26^ including
healthy college students,^35,\ 36^ who seek stimulant medications to
improve cognitive performance, The absence of a true "gold-standard"
diagnosis, the variability in performance of diagnostic tools among
clinicians and settings, and the lack of clear practice guidelines
further add to diagnostic complexity.^37-40^

The diagnosis of ADHD in adults is often made by primary care providers
and nurse practitioners^41^ rather than specialists, and the dispensing
of ADHD medications has been increasing steadily, highlighting the need
for effective diagnostic tools and guidelines.^33^ The existing
standards and guidelines for diagnosing ADHD in adults are limited, and
the use of diagnostic tools and assessments varies widely in
practice.^42-44^ No guidelines for the diagnosis of adults with ADHD
have thus far been developed in the United States, though one is in
development.^45^ The accuracy of diagnosis directly affects the
management and treatment of ADHD, as well as the prevention of
medication misuse. The diagnostic accuracy of tools and assessments used
in adult ADHD diagnosis is unclear, however, and their performance may
vary depending on the characteristics of the ADHD participants and
comparator samples.^27,\ 28^

2.  []{#_Toc178627499 .anchor}Purpose and Scope

This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and unbiased
assessment of the diagnostic tools used to diagnose ADHD in adults to
inform patients, clinicians, and policy makers. Initiated by the FDA,
this Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report will
document the available evidence. We will explore the effects of the
setting and participant characteristics that may influence the
diagnostic performance A contextual question is which tools are
frequently being used in current clinical practice.

1.  []{#_Toc178627500 .anchor}Methods

The systematic review followed a systematic review protocol that
outlines the methods in detail.^46^ The methodology followed the EPC
Methods Guide.^47^ The review is registered as Registration
CRD42025638106. The project was supported by a multidisciplinary
technical expert panel (TEP). The panel was designed to provide
different perspectives of a broad group of stakeholders to ensure the
evidence report on diagnosis of ADHD is relevant to a large audience.
The panel includes experts specifically in adult ADHD and considered the
needs of affected patients as well as family members.

[]{#_Toc193710594 .anchor}2.2 Key Questions

The systematic review was guided by the following key questions:

- Key Question 1. What is the comparative diagnostic accuracy,
  unintended consequences and impact of tools that can be used in the
  primary care practice setting or by specialists to diagnose ADHD among
  adults?

  - Key Question 1a: How does the comparative diagnostic accuracy of
    these tools vary by clinical setting, including primary care or
    specialty clinic, or patient characteristics, including age, sex,
    cultural background, and risk factors associated with ADHD?

In addition, a contextual question provided additional information:

- Contextual Question. How frequently are the various tools to diagnose
  ADHD in adults currently being used?

[]{#_Toc178627503 .anchor}2.3 Logic Model

Figure 1 illustrates the scope of the review.

Notes: ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, KQ key question

The model shows the population of interest (adults with suspected ADHD)
and depicts the key question (diagnostic test performance) and
sub-question (effect modifiers). The model also shows outcomes, ranging
from side effects of the testing modality (e.g., relevant for invasive
tests), to intermediate outcomes such as the diagnostic accuracy
established in the study, to final outcomes such as the impact of a
diagnosing or misdiagnosing ADHD.

[]{#_Toc178627504 .anchor}2.4 Search Strategy

The literature search for studies on diagnosing ADHD in adults used a
combination of known tests to diagnose ADHD and general search terms for
diagnostic accuracy studies to identify novel tools. We searched PubMed
(biomedical literature), EMBASE (pharmacology emphasis), and PsycINFO
(psychological research) without search date restriction and restricted
to English language. The search strategy was peer reviewed within the
EPC program. We used existing reviews for reference-mining; these were
identified through the same databases plus searching the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, Campbell Collaboration, and PROSPERO. We
also searched the ECRI repository, G-I-N, and ClinicalKey for published
guidelines and used these for reference-mining cited literature. All
searches will be updated during the public comment period.

In addition, we leveraged technical experts to ensure that relevant
research studies have been identified. We provided a list of included
studies, together with all associated publications, and a list of
excluded studies to facilitate this process. A Supplemental Evidence And
Data for Systematic Reviews (SEADs) portal was available from January 10
to February 4 for this review. Additional data and publications
suggested to us from any source, including peer and public review, will
be screened applying the outlined eligibility criteria.

Included ADHD tests were not limited to a set of pre-specified tools;
instead, the review documents all tools that have been evaluated in the
scientific literature and for which diagnostic accuracy evidence exists.
There are no publication date restrictions. Studies with data
exclusively published in non-English language publications were excluded
to ensure transparency. We obtained all published reports providing data
on a study (a study is defined by the included participants), including
trial records and multiple publications, and consolidated the
information into one study record.

[]{#_Toc178627507 .anchor}2.5.1 Screening Process

We used an online database designed for systematic reviews to screen the
literature search output. The team designed detailed citation and full
text screening forms to ensure a transparent, consistent, and
unambiguous approach. All citations were screened by two independent
literature reviewers. Citations found to be potentially relevant by at
least one reviewer were obtained as full text. All citations were also
screened by a DistillerSR software machine learning algorithm trained by
the human reviewers to ensure that no relevant citation was missed. Any
citations identified as potentially relevant by the algorithm that were
not selected for full text publication review were rescreened for
relevance by an independent literature reviewer.

Full text screening applied the detailed eligibility criteria. Training
ensured a shared understanding of all inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Full text publications were screened by two independent reviewers to
reduce errors and bias, and any discrepancy was resolved through
discussion in the review team. The screening decisions and reasons for
exclusion of publications were tracked in the online database and
citation management software. These citations were shared with the
technical expert panel and were documented with the review to ensure
that the literature flow was transparent and objective.

[]{#_Toc193710599 .anchor}2.6 Data Extraction

The data abstraction captured detailed information about eligible
studies. One literature reviewer abstracted the data and an experienced
methodologist checked the data for accuracy and completeness. We
designed a detailed data extraction form in the software DistillerSR.

The data abstraction documented the targeted population, abstracted
reported characteristics for all participants (participants with ADHD
and those without). We documented the clinical setting, abstracted the
method of establishing the reference standard (a clinical ADHD
diagnosis), and abstracted diagnostic tool characteristics (format, name
of the tool, employed cut offs, use of a training and validation set).
We collected data for a diagnostic meta-analysis where possible (i.e.,
number of false positives, number of false negatives) along with the
summary diagnosis accuracy measures reported by the authors such as
sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, positive predictive
value. We differentiated between the diagnostic accuracy to diagnose
ADHD and the diagnostic accuracy to detect faking ADHD. For all studies
reporting multiple results, we selected the best accuracy performance
model (either based on the authors' opinion, accuracy data, or trying to
maximize sensitivity and specificity simultaneously).

[]{#_Toc193710600 .anchor}2.7 Risk of Bias Assessment

The critical appraisal for individual studies applied criteria
consistent with QUADAS 2.^48^ QUADAS-2 evaluates four domains: *patient
selection*, *index test* characteristics, *reference standard* quality,
as well as *flow and timing:*

- Patient selection: The domain addresses whether the selection of
  patients could have introduced bias, taking into account whether the
  study enrolled a consecutive or random sample, whether the data are
  not based on a retrospective case-control design, and whether the
  study avoided inappropriate or problematic exclusions from the patient
  pool.

- Index test: The domain evaluates whether the conduct or interpretation
  of the test could have introduced bias, taking into account whether
  the results of the test were interpreted without knowledge of the
  results of the reference standard and whether any thresholds or
  cut-offs were pre-specified (e.g., instead of determined during the
  study to maximize diagnostic performance).

- Reference standard: The domain evaluates whether the reference
  standard, its conduct, or its interpretation may have introduced bias,
  taking into account the quality of the reference standard in correctly
  classifying the condition and whether the reference standard test
  results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index
  test.

- Flow and timing: The last domain evaluates whether the conduct of the
  study may have introduced bias. The assessment takes into account
  whether the interval between the test and the reference standard was
  appropriate, whether all patients received the reference standard and
  whether they received the same reference standard, and whether all
  patients were included in the analysis.

For each domain, we assessed the potential risk of bias in the study in
order to identify high risk of bias and low risk of bias studies. One
literature reviewer assessed risk of bias, and a methodologist reviewed
individual studies and rating across studies to ensure accuracy and
consistency of ratings. As outlined in the applicability section, we
also evaluated for each study and appraisal domain whether there were
concerns regarding the applicability of the study results to the review
question. This encompassed whether the patients included in the studies
matched the review question; whether the test, its conduct, or
interpretation differed from the review question; or whether the target
condition as defined by the reference standard fully matched the review
question. The information was incorporated into the strength of evidence
assessment.

[]{#_Toc178627510 .anchor}2.8 Data Synthesis and Analysis

We answered the key question with the available evidence. We broadly
differentiated diagnostic tools as

- Self reports

- Peer reports

- Neuropsychological tests

- Neuroimaging

- EEG

- Biomarker

- Observational data

- Clinician tools

- Combination predictions using more than one modality

- Tests to detect feigning of ADHD

We documented comparative effect results where studies compared the
performance of more than one tool. In addition, we documented the range
of results reported in studies within each tool category (e.g., self
reports). We documented the diagnostic accuracy results for all outcomes
as reported by the authors in the individual studies. Sensitivity
estimates were documented together with specificity estimates given that
the estimates are not independent. A detailed evidence table displays
key characteristics, the reference standard, psychometric properties and
diagnostic accuracy outcomes for all included studies. In addition, we
abstracted the number of true positives, true negatives, false
positives, and false negatives where clearly reported for use in a
diagnostic meta-analysis. All studies were considered for the narrative
synthesis accompanying the summary of findings table.

We documented the results for available diagnostic tools across studies
in a comprehensive summary of findings table documenting all assessed
outcomes related to the diagnosis, reliability, and impact of the tool.
Key outcomes for the summary of findings table were determined with the
help of the TEP:

- Misdiagnosis (risk of missed condition that can appear as ADHD)

- Sensitivity

- Specificity

- Administration and scoring time

- Inter-rater reliability

- Costs

- Diagnostic concordance of primary care provider with specialist

The synthesis took study limitations and the risk of bias of individual
studies contributing to estimates into account. In particular, we
determined whether summary estimates corresponded to data reported in
low risk of bias studies or were primarily based on high risk of
studies.

To address the sub-question, we reported on subgroup results for
different clinical settings (differentiating general and specialty care
settings), patient characteristics (differentiating sex, age, cultural
background, and comorbidity groups), and ADHD presentation
(differentiating predominantly inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive,
combined). We assessed whether these variables can explain heterogeneity
identified in results across studies.

To address the contextual question we documented the frequency of
identified research for each individual tool. In addition, we summarized
data sources that reported on the frequency of tool use in clinical
practice with emphasis on the U.S. healthcare setting in the discussion.

[]{#_Toc193710602 .anchor}2.9 Grading the Strength of the Body of
Evidence

We applied the EPC strength of evidence criteria to evaluate the body of
evidence. In determining the quality of the body of evidence, the
following domains were evaluated:

- Study limitations: The extent to which studies reporting on a
  particular outcome were likely to be protected from bias. The
  aggregate risk of bias across individual studies reporting an outcome
  was considered; graded as low, medium, or high level of study
  limitations.

- Inconsistency: The extent to which studies reported the same direction
  and/or magnitude of effects for a particular outcome; graded as
  consistent, inconsistent, or unknown (in the case of a single study or
  the absence of studies).

- Indirectness: Determines whether the test and the comparator were
  directly (i.e., within studies) or indirectly (e.g., across studies)
  compared. The domain was graded as direct or indirect.

- Imprecision: Describes the level of certainty of the estimate of
  effect for a particular outcome, where a precise estimate is one that
  allows a clinically useful conclusion. The domain was graded as
  precise or imprecise.

- Reporting bias: Publication bias, selective outcome reporting, and
  selective analysis reporting are types of reporting bias. Reporting
  bias is difficult to assess as systematic identification of
  unpublished evidence is challenging.

A final [[strength of evidence]{.underline}](#SoE) grade for each
evidence statement was assigned by evaluating and weighing the combined
results of the above domains. We differentiated an overall grade of
high, moderate, low, or insufficient according to a four-level scale:

- High: We are very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to
  the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has few or no
  deficiencies. We believe that the findings are stable (i.e., another
  study would not change the conclusions).

- Moderate: We are moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies
  close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has
  some deficiencies. We believe that the findings are likely to be
  stable, but some doubt remains.

- Low: We have limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close
  to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has major or
  numerous deficiencies (or both). We believe that additional evidence
  is needed before concluding either that the findings are stable or
  that the estimate of effect is close to the true effect.

- Insufficient: We have no evidence, we are unable to estimate an
  effect, or we have no confidence in the estimate of effect for this
  outcome. No evidence is available, or the body of evidence has
  unacceptable deficiencies, precluding reaching a conclusion.

Summary tables included reasons for downgrading or upgrading the
strength of evidence. The strength of evidence assessment documented
uncertainty and communicated our confidence in the evidence statements
that can be drawn from the literature.

[]{#_Toc193710603 .anchor}2.10 Assessing Applicability

Results are based on the international literature and applicability
ratings provided assessments regarding the generalizability of samples,
settings, and tool results for U.S. clinical practice. For each study,
we assessed the population included in the study to identify studies
with narrow eligibility criteria (e.g., looking for a specific subgroup
of ADHD participants only), studies that excluded participants with
comorbidities, or studies that had more complex participants than
typically seen in the community (e.g., dually diagnosed participants).
We assessed whether studies described tools not used as recommended or
commonly used in practice, the presence of highly trained test team or
set up (e.g., analysis via complex machine learning models), or
assessors that were not qualified for the assessment. We assessed
whether the reference standard was ambiguous, different from standard
clinical practice, or insufficiently described.

Included studies for diagnosis review n = 114 studies

We identified 114 studies meeting inclusion criteria. The earliest
identified study was published in 1998. Studies evaluated tools in
Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel,
Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, USA, or
combined evaluations in multiple countries. Sample sizes varied widely,
from a dozen participants to large samples with over a thousand
participants, respectively.^50-52^ Studies included participants
diagnosed with ADHD and compared to different non-ADHD samples. These
included neurotypical adults not diagnosed with ADHD, adults from a
clinical sample evaluated or diagnosed for another clinical condition,
and/or adults feigning ADHD. Half of the included studies (51%) included
a neurotypical group of adults that did not meet criteria for ADHD and
in some cases were also selected specifically because they also never
had a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Many studies (40%) compared to a
clinical sample of participants that was being evaluated for another
clinical condition. In addition, two studies each compared to
participants with autism,^53,\ 54^ participants with conduct disorder or
anger dysregulation,^55,\ 56^ or participants with depression,^57,\ 58^
respectively. A quarter (23%) of the identified studies included
participants identified or specifically trained to pretend to have ADHD.
Studies varied in whether they included an additional group (e.g., a
neurotypical or clinical sample), but some studies included only
participants feigning ADHD, which were compared to participants with a
diagnosis of ADHD.^59-62^

Identified studies reported on self-report questionnaires, peer review
tools, neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalogram
(EEG), diverse biomarkers, clinician tools, combinations of modalities,
and tools to identify feigning ADHD. Studies reported on the success of
identifying ADHD, success in identifying feigning and exaggerating of
ADHD symptoms, or both.

    diagnostic accuracy, unintended consequences, and impact of tools
    that can be used in the primary care practice setting or by
    specialists to diagnose ADHD among adults?

We identified a number of studies that included multiple tools used
alone or in combination. However, not all studies reported diagnostic
performance for all tools and combinations, and only selected studies
allowed direct comparisons.

The 11 studies with head-to-head comparisons between modalities compared
primarily self report questionnaires with other modalities: compared to
parent rating,{#685} peer report,{#5349}{#10626} a combination of self
and other rating,{#949}{#5349}{#10626} neuropsychological

Several studies compared multiple tests, but not all reported
coefficients for every test. All available comparative results across
test modalities (e.g., combinations of variables vs neuropsychological
test results alone) are documented in the summary of findings table.

[]{#_Toc193710607 .anchor}Combination

Seven studies reported on a combination of input from different
modalities.{#325}{#949}{#5100}{#5349}{#10626}{#10710}{#10732} Several
included self and informant symptom ratings, and some also used
demographic variables, neuropsychological assessment results, or EEG
data. Studies varied in their complexity of the combination; one study,
supported by machine learning, used 93 variables.{#5100} The Appendix
Table A1 documents results for all studies that evaluated a combination.
The table shows the specific combinations used to correctly diagnose
ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of
Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710608 .anchor}Self Reports

Forty-one studies reported at least one self report measure evaluated
for its performance in diagnosing ADHD. The studies reported on numerous
self report measures: ADHD Rating Scale, AHA, ALS-SF, APQ, ARS, ASRS,
ASSET-BS, BAARS-IV, BADDS, CAARS, CBS, EarlyDetect Questionnaire,
IPDE-SQ, PAI, PDI-4, SR-WRAADDS, and WURS (see evidence table in the
appendix for more information). The Appendix Table A2 documents results
for all studies that evaluated a written self report for the diagnosis
of ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of
Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710609 .anchor}Peer Ratings

Two studies evaluated peer reports.{#685}{#10626} One of the studies
asked parents to rate their young adults with autism using the CAARS-P
and the ABC (Aberrant Behavior Checklist).{#685} The other study
included parent ratings of undergraduates using the BAARS-IV (Barkley
Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV).{#10526} The Appendix Table A3 documents
results for the small number of studies that evaluated a written peer
report for the diagnosis of ADHD. In both cases, the peer report was a
parent rating of young adults. Results for key outcomes are synthesized
in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710610 .anchor}Neuropsychological Assessment

Twenty-six studies reported on the performance of neuropsychological
assessment to diagnose ADHD. Studies evaluated test batteries such as
AQT, BQSS, C-CPT, DII, IVA, MOXO-dCPT, QbTest, SCWT, SNST, or the
performance of individual tasks such as the Go-No-Go task or WAIS-IV
Processing Speed Index. The Appendix Table A4 documents results for all
neuropsychological test evaluated to diagnose ADHD. The index test
description shows the evaluated test selection that showed the best
performance, together with all administered tests. Results for key
outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710611 .anchor}Neuroimaging

Five studies evaluated neuroimaging.{#28}{#134}{#812}{#870}{#1011}
Studies used Brain Perfusion SPECT (single-photon emission computed
tomography),{#28} 3-D SPECT,{#812} structural MRI and diffusion tensor
imaging,{#134} and resting state functional MRI.{#970}{#1011} The
Appendix Table A5 documents results of studies that evaluated
neuroimaging for the diagnosis of ADHD. The table provides details on
the final selection model where reported. Results for key outcomes are
synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710612 .anchor}EEG

Eleven studies evaluated EEG (electroencephalogram)
data.{#73}{#334}{#436}{#448}{#454}{#640}{#642}{#722}{#729}{#840}{#425}
Studies tested very different conditions, ranging from analyzing resting
state EEG,{#448}{#722} event-related potentials during
neuropsychological tasks,{#73}{#640} to EEG recording during
transcranial magnetic stimulation.{#334} The Appendix Table A6 documents
results for the studies that evaluated the use of EEG data for the
diagnosis of ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the
Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710613 .anchor}Biomarker

Five studies evaluated biomarkers other than EEG or
neuroimaging-based.{#327}{#417}{#832}{#5003}{#5685} Studies evaluated
genetic marker,{#327} eye tracking,{#417} blood oxidative status,{#832}
physiological data from a wearable device,{#5003} or used MFNU (Motor
Function Neurological Assessment){#5685} to diagnose ADHD. The Appendix
Table A7 documents results for the small number of studies that
evaluated the use of biomarkers other than neuroimaging or EEG for the
diagnosis of ADHD. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the
Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193710614 .anchor}Clinician Tool

Three studies reported on a clinician interview or questionnaire that
was assessed for congruence with an external reference
standard.{#684}{#4185}{#5349} Studies evaluated the MINI
(Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview),{#4185} MINI-Plus,{#684}
and the CAARS-O (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales){#5349 in clinical
samples. The reference standards were assessments from trained
clinicians,{#684} the recorded chart diagnosis,{#4185} or clinical
consensus meeting with multiple clinicians.{#5349}

[]{#_Toc193710615 .anchor}Key Question 1a: How does the comparative
diagnostic accuracy of tools vary by clinical setting or patient
characteristics?

Because raw data for diagnostic accuracy were often not reported, we
were not able to detect effect modifiers in meta-regressions by adding
variables to the meta-analytic model. Results are based on subgroups as
reported by the authors and analyses conducted within the original
studies.

**Clinical setting**: Half of the identified studies were conducted in
specialty care (n=55). The next most frequent setting was college
(n=37). Very few studies were conducted in primary care (n=2). In
addition, none of the identified studies analyzed the effect of the
setting on the diagnostic process. Hence the question which tests should
be used in primary care is difficult to answer. However, several studies
addressed the effect of the reference standard and comparator sample,
i.e., study characteristics. In addition, several studies addressed the
effect of comorbidities. Although primarily a patient characteristic,
participants evaluated for other clinical conditions was more typical of
a specialty care clinical setting.

**Reference standard and comparator sample**: Three studies addressed
the effect of the method of establishing a clinical ADHD diagnosis, but
all addressed different aspects. One study comparing self reports and
neuropsychological tests highlighted that diagnostic accuracy measures
were high when comparing ADHD-diagnosed participants to the general
population but were less effective when distinguishing ADHD from other
psychiatric conditions, with overlapping scores noted for anxiety and
depression.{#870} Similarly, a self report study reported a high
false-positive rate in patients with depression.{#212} Another
self-report study reported that comorbidities such as anxiety and
depression were associated with elevated scores on scales which may
overlap with ADHD symptoms and potentially contribute to
misclassification and highlighted the importance of considering comorbid
conditions during assessment.{#495} One study evaluating neuromuscular
assessment reported that they found several patients with subthreshold
ADHD in a clinical sample suggesting possible diagnostic overlap and the
need for further evaluation.{#5685}

**ADHD presentation**: Four studies addressed diagnosis in different
presentations of ADHD with some conflicting results. One-self report
study reported that diagnostic accuracy did not significantly vary
across ADHD presentations/subtypes (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive,
and combined) but noted that combined type ADHD was the most frequently
identified subtype, which could influence overall sensitivity and
specificity estimates.{#857} Similarly, another study reported that
sensitivity and specificity were consistent across ADHD presentation
types (inattentive, hyperactive, and combined), but noted that
misdiagnosis rates were slightly higher for the inattentive subtype in
self-reports compared to clinician diagnoses, and inter-rater
reliability between self-report and clinical ratings was moderate, with
higher concordance for combined presentation.{#5176} Another self-report
study highlighted that sensitivity for the inattentive subtype was 100
percent on the Inattentive Symptoms subscale, with specificity at
25%.{#490} One self-report study pointed out that inattention symptoms
were more predictive of ADHD persistence into adulthood than
hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms; and individuals with the
combined-type ADHD in childhood were more likely to retain a diagnosis
in adulthood, whereas hyperactive-impulsive presentations were more
likely to remit.{#444}

**Participant age**: Several studies reported on the effect of the age
of the participants or specifically on the age at diagnosis, but studies
focused on different aspects. A self report study reported that
executive functioning impairments were more predictive of ADHD
persistence in older adults, while hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms
were more prevalent in younger adults, suggesting age-related shifts in
symptom expression and diagnostic criteria applicability; sensitivity
and specificity of ADHD diagnoses were higher in younger adults (18--30
years) compared to older adults (31--44 years), likely due to better
recall of childhood symptoms and reduced cognitive decline in
memory-based reporting.{#444} A self report and neuropsychological test
study reported that age was inversely correlated with scores on scales
for attention and effort, suggesting that older participants exhibited
fewer ADHD-related symptoms, potentially reflecting developmental
improvements in executive functioning.{#870} One study did not comment
on differential effects on the diagnosis, but suggested that a potential
biomarker, oxidative stress, may increase with the duration of the
disease.{#832} Another study found that age represented as independent
variable in a multiple regression did not significantly influence
parameters measured by the QbTest.{#111} A further study reported that
ADHD diagnosis based on CAARS-S or MINI were not correlated with
age.{#4185}

**Participant sex**: Several studies reported on the effect of the sex
of the participants on the diagnostic performance, but studies reported
conflicting results. One EEG study reported lower sensitivity in females
compared to males.{#425} A neuroimaging study noted that classification
performance was higher in the male-only subgroup compared to the
mixed-gender subgroup, suggesting that male ADHD patients may have more
significant neuroanatomical deviations from controls.{#134} A self
report study did not find lower sensitivity but lower specificity in
females versus males.{#960} One study concluded that sex did not
influence parameters of the neuropsychological test.{#111} A self report
study did not detect differences in sensitivity and specificity between
sexes.{#1916} A study reporting on a self report and a clinician
interview noted that ADHD diagnosis based on the tests were not
correlated with sex.{#4185}

**Participant ethnicity**: None of the studies stratified diagnostic
performance by race or ethnicity.

**Comorbidities**: Multiple studies reported on the effect of
comorbidities in participants with ADHD on diagnostic performance, but
results and conclusions differed. One college study reported that
comorbidities contributed to challenges in specificity but not
sensitivity and that functional impairment was higher in participants
with comorbid conditions.{#490} Similarly, a study in addiction centers
reported on variability in specificity values across subgroups while
sensitivity remained similar.{#942} Another study reported reduced
specificity in participants with overlapping symptoms of borderline
personality disorder and bipolar disorder in neuropsychiatric
clinics.{#220} One study reported lower sensitivity and higher
specificity in participants with comorbidity in a mental health
center.{#536} Two studies in outpatient centers reported that diagnostic
performance was unaffected by comorbidities.{#111}{#495} Some studies
pointed out the high prevalence of comorbid conditions such as
depression and anxiety.{#857}{#4485}{#444}{#323} One study suggested
that participants with ADHD and depression reported higher levels of
anxiety.{#212}

[]{#_Toc193710616 .anchor}Key Question 1 Summary of Findings

Despite the large number of studies, many did not report on the exact
number of true positives, true negatives etc. The most common metrics
were the author reported sensitivity. Given that sensitivity and
specificity are not independent of each other, we plotted both for all
reported tests in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Sensitivity and Specificity of Tests

![A graph with different colored dots AI-generated content may be

height="5.330189195100613in"}

The figure visualizes the much larger evidence base for self reports
compared to all other modalities. The figure also illustrates the wide
variability reported in the individual studies for the same modality. In
addition, the visualization shows that tests were sometimes able to
maximize sensitivity or specificity, but not both. Finally, with few
exceptions, the evaluated tests were limited in their success of
detecting a clinical diagnosis of ADHD.

The summary of findings table (Table 3) provides a synthesis of the
results for the key outcomes. Direct comparisons between test modalities
are shown first, followed by the test performance for individual tests,
and the summary of the subquestion. The summary of findings table shows
results for the key outcomes for which at least one study with data was
identified. The clinical misdiagnosis results were limited to studies
reporting on clinical samples and/or studies comparing to another
clinical condition such as anxiety.

To broadly characterize the magnitude of effects, we described false
positive rate as moderate when the majority of studies reported values
below 20 and as substantial for rates close to 50 percent of incorrectly
classified. We described sensitivity and specificity as fair for values
below 80, as acceptable above 80 but below 90 percent, as good if most
values fell between 90 and 95 percent, and as excellent for values above
95 percent. We describe administration time under 30 minutes as short
administration. For rater agreement we described kappa below 0.8 and
correlations below 0.40 as limited.

Results of individual studies for all abstracted outcomes are shown in
the evidence tables in the appendix.

Notes: KQ key question, N/A not applicable or not available

We identified numerous studies reporting on the performance of tests for
detecting feigning ADHD. Studies used subjective and objective tests.
Results are shown in the evidence table in the appendix (Appendix Table
A9).

The included studies did not report on the impact for participants of
being correctly or incorrectly diagnosed. Studies reported only on the
performance of the tests but not the effect a diagnosis (or a
misdiagnosis) had on participants or similar.

None of the included studies reported on unintended consequences,
adverse events, adverse effects, or side effects of the diagnostic
tools, including blood-based biomarker, EEG, neuroimaging, and
neuropsychological test studies.
