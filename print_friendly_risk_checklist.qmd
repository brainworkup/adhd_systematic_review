# Systematic Framework for Bias Evaluation

## I. Established Criteria - QUADAS-2 Framework

The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool provides the foundational framework for evaluating risk of bias, specifically adapted for adult ADHD diagnostic studies.

### Domain 1: Patient Selection {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}
#### Low Risk Criteria
- Consecutive or random sampling explicitly documented
- Case-control design avoided or appropriately justified
- Inappropriate exclusions avoided
- Clear documentation of recruitment strategy
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
#### Unclear Risk Indicators
- Insufficient description of sampling methodology
- Ambiguous selection criteria
- Limited documentation of recruitment process
- Unclear timeline of participant enrollment
:::

::: {.callout-important}
#### High Risk Markers
- Non-consecutive or non-random sampling
- Inappropriate case-control design
- Inappropriate exclusions affecting representativeness
- Substantial selection bias evident
:::

### Domain 2: Index Test {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}
#### Low Risk Criteria
- Test conducted according to standardized protocol
- Threshold pre-specified
- Test interpreters blinded to reference standard
- Clear documentation of test administration
:::

### Domain 3: Reference Standard {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}
#### Low Risk Criteria
- DSM-5/ICD-10 criteria properly implemented
- Reference standard results interpreted blind to index test
- Standardized diagnostic protocol followed
- Multi-informant data collection
:::

### Domain 4: Flow and Timing {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}
#### Low Risk Criteria
- Appropriate interval between index test and reference standard
- All participants receive same reference standard
- All participants included in analysis
- Clear documentation of assessment timeline
:::

## II. Inter-rater Reliability Assessment

## VI. Clinical Implications

The systematic implementation of these criteria ensures:

1. Standardized evaluation across studies
2. Reliable risk assessment
3. Transparent decision-making
4. Reproducible methodology
5. Clinical validity enhancement

This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating methodological rigor in adult ADHD diagnostic studies, facilitating reliable inter-rater assessment and maintaining consistency in bias evaluation.
