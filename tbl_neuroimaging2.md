# Neuroimaging Studies in Adult ADHD: Demographics Summary Table

Based on my review of the 8 provided research papers on neuroimaging studies in ADHD, I've compiled a summary table of key demographic information. This table focuses on sample characteristics, imaging modalities used, and basic study parameters.

| Study | Sample Size | Age (Mean ± SD) | Gender Distribution | Imaging Modality | Key Population Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Amen et al. (2021) | ADHD: 1,006<br>Controls: 129 | ADHD: 37.7 ± 15.5<br>Controls: 45.4 ± 16.9 | ADHD: 34% female<br>Controls: 44% female | SPECT | Non-comorbid ADHD patients; baseline SPECT scans analyzed using ROI approach |
| Chaim-Avancini et al. (2017) | ADHD: 67<br>Controls: 66 | ADHD: 27.0 ± 6.0<br>Controls: 26.7 ± 5.7 | ADHD: 56 males, 11 females<br>Controls: 44 males, 22 females | Structural MRI & DTI | Stimulant-naïve adults with childhood-onset ADHD; machine learning analysis |
| Wang et al. (2013) | ADHD: 23<br>Controls: 23 | ADHD: 35.14 ± 9.75<br>Controls: 32.04 ± 9.23 | Both groups: 18 males, 5 females | SPECT | Treatment-naïve adults; regional homogeneity analysis |
| Wolfers et al. (2016) | ADHD: 184<br>Siblings: 103<br>Controls: 128 | ADHD: 17.24 ± 3.27<br>Siblings: 17.12 ± 4.06<br>Controls: 16.36 ± 3.24 | ADHD: 128 males, 56 females<br>Siblings: 41 males, 62 females<br>Controls: 60 males, 68 females | fMRI | Compared unaffected siblings, ADHD patients, and controls; pattern recognition analysis |
| Schneider et al. (2014) | 427 total patients<br>(ADHD percentage not specified) | 40.9 ± 15.7 | 51.1% female | SPECT | Retrospective analysis comparing conventional vs. 3D thresholded SPECT; included patients from various psychiatric practices |
| Wang et al. (2022) | ADHD: 184<br>Controls: 128 | ADHD: 17.24 ± 3.27<br>Controls: 16.36 ± 3.24 | ADHD: 70% male<br>Controls: 47% male | fMRI | Machine learning approach using ADHD-200 dataset |
| Yao et al. (2018) | ADHD adults: 112<br>Controls: 77<br>ADHD children: 34<br>Child controls: 28 | Adults ADHD: 25.93 ± 4.86<br>Adult Controls: 26.04 ± 3.94<br>Child ADHD: 9.79 ± 1.86<br>Child Controls: 10.29 ± 1.67 | Adults: ADHD 75 males, 37 females<br>Controls: 43 males, 34 females<br>Children: All boys | fMRI | Novel feature selection method for classification; functional connectivity analysis |
| Alves et al. (2024) | ADHD: 184<br>Controls: 128<br>ASD: 539 | Not fully specified across groups | ADHD: 70% male<br>Controls: 47% male | fMRI | Multiclass classification of ADHD, ASD, and controls using machine learning |

**Notes:**
- Most studies used adult or adolescent/young adult samples
- Male participants generally outnumbered female participants across studies
- Common imaging modalities included SPECT, MRI (structural and DTI), and fMRI
- Machine learning and pattern recognition approaches were frequently used for classification
- Several studies specifically mentioned including stimulant-naïve participants

This demographic summary provides context for understanding the neuroimaging findings related to ADHD diagnosis discussed in these papers.
