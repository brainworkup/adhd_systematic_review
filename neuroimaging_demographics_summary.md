| Schneider (2014) | N=427, 40% ADHD, 60% Other Psych | 40.9 years ± 15.7 | Not fully extracted | DSM-IV criteria | DTI | Pediatric population (younger than 18 years); Focus on white matter tracts |
| Wang (2023) | 50 ADHD, 50 controls | Not fully extracted | Not fully extracted | Inattentive, Hyperactive/Impulsive, Combined | fMRI | Used ADHD-200 dataset; analysis using convolutional neural networks |
| Wang (2013) | 23 ADHD, 23 controls | 35.14 ± 9.75 (ADHD), 32.04 ± 9.23 (Controls) | 18 males/5 females in both groups | All Combined Type | MRI | Focus on resting-state fMRI; All patients met lifetime criteria for Combined Type ADHD |
| Wolfers (2016) | 184 ADHD, 103 unaffected siblings, 128 controls | Not fully extracted | Not fully extracted | Not fully extracted | fMRI | Used Stop-Signal Task paradigm to assess response inhibition; included unaffected siblings as comparison group |
| Yao (2018) | 112 ADHD, 77 controls (adults); 34 ADHD, 28 controls (children) | Adults: 25.93±4.86 (ADHD), 26.04±3.94 (controls); Children: 9.79±1.86 (ADHD), 10.29±1.67 (controls) | Adults: 37F/75M (ADHD), 34F/43M (controls); Children: All male | Not fully extracted | fMRI | Used two separate datasets (adults and children); Focus on default mode network |

## Summary of Demographic Patterns

1. **Sample Sizes**: Studies range from smaller samples (20-30 per group) to very large samples (Amen study with over 1,000 ADHD participants)

2. **Age**: Studies included both pediatric (Schneider: mean age 14.1 years; Yao children's dataset: mean age 9.8 years) and adult populations (Wang 2013: mean age 35.1 years; Chaim-Avancini: mean age 27 years; Yao adults: mean age 25.9 years)

3. **Gender Distribution**: Where reported, there was a male predominance in ADHD groups: 
   - Chaim-Avancini: 78% male 
   - Wang 2013: 78% male
   - Yao 2018 (adults): 67% male
   - Yao 2018 (children): 100% male (all boys design)
   This is consistent with known ADHD gender distribution in clinical samples.

4. **ADHD Subtypes**: Where reported, both Inattentive and Combined subtypes were commonly included. The Wang 2013 study specifically focused on Combined Type ADHD only, while Chaim-Avancini included more Inattentive (n=36) than Combined (n=31) subtypes.

5. **Imaging Modalities**: Studies employed diverse neuroimaging techniques:
   - MRI (structural magnetic resonance imaging)
   - fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)
   - DTI (diffusion tensor imaging)
   - SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography)
   - EEG (electroencephalography)

6. **Control Matching**: All studies included matched control groups, with the Amen study specifically noting controls had no psychiatric diagnoses, brain injuries, or substance use

## Notes on Demographic Reporting

While all studies included the basic information on sample sizes and diagnostic groups, detailed demographic reporting was inconsistent across studies. Future research would benefit from standardized reporting of:
- Age ranges and means with standard deviations
- Complete gender distributions
- Education levels
- ADHD subtype classifications
- Medication status
- Comorbidity details

**Summary of Key Findings on Neuroimaging Tools for Diagnosing ADHD in Adults:**

1. **Altered Brain Structure and Function:** Studies have identified altered brain structure and function in adults with ADHD, particularly in regions responsible for attention and impulse control, such as the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia (Alves, 2024; Amen, 2021).
2. **Abnormalities in White Matter Tracts:** Research has shown abnormalities in white matter tracts, including reduced fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of ADHD (Schneider, 2014; Wang, 2023).
3. **Differences in Brain Activity:** Neuroimaging studies have found differences in brain activity between adults with ADHD and healthy controls, including altered activation in the default mode network and frontal-striatal circuits (Wang, 2013; Wolfers, 2016).
4. **Association with Cognitive Deficits:** Neuroimaging findings have been associated with cognitive deficits in adults with ADHD, such as attentional bias and working memory impairments (Yao, 2018).
5. **Potential Biomarkers for Diagnosis:** Some studies have identified potential biomarkers for ADHD diagnosis, including abnormal brain structure and function in regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (Chaim-Avancini, 2017).
