Note: This table compiles findings from studies included in the literature review. Some studies report ranges rather than specific values. Sample sizes varied considerably across studies. "Not specified" indicates the information was not clearly provided in the reviewed papers. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) are provided where sensitivity/specificity were not explicitly stated.

Key points from this expanded table:

1. **Battery approaches consistently outperform individual tests** - Combined measures such as in Lovejoy et al., Nielsen & Wiig, Kovner et al., and Emser et al. show higher sensitivity and specificity than single measures.

2. **Variability across individual measures** - Single neuropsychological tests show widely varying sensitivity (19-87%) but generally good specificity (often >90%).

3. **Age considerations** - Some studies report different values for children versus adults, reflecting developmental differences in test performance.

4. **Motion tracking adds value** - Tests that incorporate both cognitive measures and motion tracking (like QbTest+) often demonstrate better diagnostic accuracy.

5. **Clinical versus healthy controls** - Specificity tends to be lower when differentiating ADHD from other clinical conditions compared to healthy controls.

6. **Combining objective and subjective measures** - The highest diagnostic accuracy is achieved when combining objective neuropsychological tests with subjective rating scales.

These findings highlight that while no single neuropsychological test is sufficient for diagnosing adult ADHD, carefully selected batteries of tests combined with clinical ratings can provide valuable objective information to support the diagnostic process.
